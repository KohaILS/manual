.. _results-overview-label:

Results overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|opacsearchresults|

After performing a search, the number of results found for the search
will appear above the results.

By default, the search results are sorted based on the
:ref:`OPACdefaultSortField and OPACdefaultSortOrder <opacdefaultsortfield-and-opacdefaultsortorder-label>`

choose another sorting method from the drop-down menu on the right.

|sortingresults|

Under each title in the results list, there will be a series of values from the 
record's leader (field 000). 

|opacsearchresultsingle|

.. Note:: 
  
   These values have nothing to do with the item types or collection codes you 
   have applied to your records or items. This data is all pulled from the 
   record's control fields.
   
   This can be turned on or off with the
   :ref:`DisplayOPACiconsXSLT <DisplayOPACiconsXSLT-label>` system preference.

Below each title, there will be the availability for the items attached to the 
record.

.. Note::

   Even if you filtered on one library location, all locations that hold
   the item will appear on the search results.

.. Warning::

   An item's hold status does not affect whether or not the item is
   'available' until the item is in 'waiting' status. Items with
   on-shelf holds will show as available until a staff member has pulled
   them from the shelf and checked the item in make it show 'waiting'.

If any :ref:`enhanced content system preferences <enhanced-content-system-preferences-label>`

:ref:`OPACComments <OPACComments-label>` preference set to allow this. Each
bibliographic record has a comments tab below the bibliographic
information.

|image991|

If the patron is logged in they will see a link to add a comment to the
item. Clicking this link will open a pop up window with a box for their
comments.

|image992|

Once the comment has been typed and the 'Submit' button clicked, the
patron will see their comment as pending and other patrons will simply
see that there are no comments on the item.

|image993|

Once the comment is approved the patron will see the number of comments
on the 'Comments' tab and their comment labeled amongst the other
comments. If the :ref:`ShowReviewerPhoto <ShowReviewerPhoto-label>` system preference is set to 'Show',
the patron's photo pulled from the `Libravatar <https://www.libravatar.org>`_
library will be displayed next to their comment.

|yourcomment|

Other patrons will see the comment with the name of the patron who left
the comment (unless you have set the :ref:`ShowReviewer <ShowReviewer-label>`
preference to not show patron names).

|image995|

If you have your :ref:`OpacShowRecentComments <OpacShowRecentComments-label>`
set to show then you'll see the approved comments on that page.

|image996|

From this page patrons can subscribe to the recent comments using RSS if
they would like.

.. _zotero-label:

Zotero
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Zotero is a Firefox add on that allows for the saving and generating of
a bibliography. Learn more about and download Zotero at
http://zotero.org.

When on the search results in the Koha OPAC, if you have Zotero
installed, you will see a folder icon in the address bar to the right of
the URL. Clicking that folder will open up a list of titles on the page
for you to pick from to add to Zotero.

|image997|

Select the titles you want to add to Zotero and then click the 'OK'
button. This will add the title to Zotero. You can see the title by
opening your Zotero library.

|image998|

.. _custom-rss-feeds-label:

Custom RSS feeds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the :ref:`RSS feeds cron job <cron-rss-feeds-label>` you can generate an RSS feed for any SQL
query (for example a new acquisitions RSS feed). The cron job is run on the
command line to produce an RSS XML document.

The output should be placed in a directory accessible to the OPAC (or
staff) web interface so that users can download the RSS feed.

An example of usage can be found at: misc/cronjobs/rss.pl
lastAcquired.conf

Normally the RSS cron job should be run periodically (e.g., daily) to keep the
feed up-to-date.

The configuration file (e.g., lastAcquired.conf) lists

-  name of the template file to use

-  path of output file

-  SQL query

The RSS cron job runs the SQL query, then feeds the output of the query through
the template to produce the output file.

    **Important**

    To use custom RSS feeds you need to turn on the :ref:`RSS cron job <cron-rss-feeds-label>`.

.. _opac-self-registration-label:

OPAC self registration
----------------------------------------------

If you allow it, patrons can register for their own accounts via the
OPAC. If you have the
:ref:`PatronSelfRegistration <PatronSelfRegistration-label>` preference set to
'Allow' then patrons will see a link to register below the log in box.

|opachomeloginform|

When the patron clicks the 'Register here' link they will be brought to a
registration page. The options on the registration page can be controlled
by editing the
:ref:`PatronSelfRegistrationBorrowerMandatoryField <PatronSelfRegistrationBorrowerMandatoryField-label>`
and the
:ref:`PatronSelfRegistrationBorrowerUnwantedField <PatronSelfRegistrationBorrowerUnwantedField-label>`
preferences.

|image1000|

Once the patron has submitted their registration they will
either be sent an email to confirm their account (if you have the
:ref:`PatronSelfRegistrationVerifyByEmail <PatronSelfRegistrationVerifyByEmail-label>`
preference to require this) or presented with their new username and
password. If the :ref:`PatronSelfRegistrationPrefillForm <PatronSelfRegistrationPrefillForm-label>` system preference is
set to 'Show and prefill', they will be presented with the prefilled login form.

|image1001|



To be notified when a patron registers via the OPAC, use the :ref:`EmailPatronRegistrations <emailpatronregistrations-and-emailaddressforpatronregistrations-label>` system preference.

Patrons registered in this way will not have a cardnumber until assigned
one by the library, but will have access to all OPAC functionality
immediately. For this reason it is recommended that you:

-  set up a provisional :ref:`patron category <adding-a-patron-category-label>` for self
   registered patrons (such as 'Self Registered) instead of using an
   existing patron category and set that value in the
   :ref:`PatronSelfRegistrationDefaultCategory <PatronSelfRegistrationDefaultCategory-label>`
   preference

-  give this patron category minimal circulation privileges in the
   :ref:`circulation and fines rules <circulation-and-fines-rules-label>` (such as allowing a
   couple holds, but no check outs)

That way patrons will either have to come in to the library to verify
their identity before given a cardnumber and the ability to check items
out or the library will have to come up with internal policy on
generating cardnumbers before providing them to self registered patrons.
Once this is done the library can change the category to one that is
more appropriate (be it an adult, resident, non resident, student, etc)
and add a cardnumber/barcode.

.. _your-account-label:

Your account
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the :ref:`opacuserlogin <opacuserlogin-label>` system preference is set to 'Allow', patrons can
log in and access their account.

Once logged in patrons are brought to their 
:ref:`account summary <your-summary-label>`. 

If patrons access the home page while logged in, and :ref:`OPACUserSummary <OPACUserSummary-label>` is 
set to 'Show', they will see a small summary of their account instead of the 
login fields.

|OPACUserSummary|

If :ref:`OPACShowSavings <opacshowsavings-label>` is set to
display savings in the summary box, this summary section will also contain the
savings the patron made by using the library rather than purchasing the items.

|OPACShowSavings-summarybox|

From any page on the OPAC, clicking on their name at the top right of the page 
will bring a patron back to their account.

.. _resetting-your-password-label:

Resetting your password
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have the :ref:`OpacResetPassword <OpacResetPassword-label>` system preference set to 'Allow',
patrons can reset their password by clicking the 'Forgot your password?'
link found under the login box.

|forgotpwlink|

Once clicked, they will be presented with a form asking for their
username and their email address.

|passwordrecover|

.. Warning::

   Patrons **must** have an email address on file to reset their password.
   If they don't have an email address already in their file, they will get 
   an error message

   |reseterror|

The system will then email the patron instructions for resetting their
password.

|resetconfirm|

The content of the email can be customized with the
:ref:`Notices and slips tool <notices-and-slips-label>`. The code of the letter 
is PASSWORD\_RESET.

If the :ref:`NotifyPasswordChange <notifypasswordchange-label>` system
preference is enabled, the patron will receive a notification indicating their
password was changed.

The content of that email can be customized with the
:ref:`Notices and slips tool <notices-and-slips-label>`. The code of the letter
is PASSWORD\_CHANGE.

.. _your-summary-label:

Your summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the 'your summary' tab, patrons will see all of the items they have 
checked out with the overdue items highlighted in red. 

|yoursummary|

:ref:`OPAC messages <opac-messages-label>` and :ref:`OPAC notes <opac-notes-label>`
will be displayed at the top of this page. For OPAC messages, the patron will
have the option to dismiss the message. This will hide the message from their
OPAC account and mark it as read, but it will not delete the message.

|opacmessage2|

You can add content to this page with the
:ref:`OpacMySummaryNote HTML customization location <html-customizations-label>`.
Content added there will appear above the patron's summary and below the
welcome message.

|OpacMySummaryNote|

If :ref:`OPACShowSavings <opacshowsavings-label>` is set to
display savings in the 'your summary' page, this section will also contain the
savings the patron made by using the library rather than purchasing the items.

|OPACShowSavings-yoursummary|

If :ref:`OpacRenewalAllowed <OpacRenewalAllowed-label>` set to 'Allow', patrons will be able to renew 
their checkouts from the OPAC.

If the patron has pending charges exceeding the value set in 
:ref:`OPACFineNoRenewals <OPACFineNoRenewals-label>`, a note will display explaining that renewals cannot 
be made.

|OPACFineNoRenewals|

A note will display if the patron cannot place holds due to their charges 
exceeding the value set in the :ref:`maxoutstanding <maxoutstanding-label>` system preference.

|maxoutstanding|

If :ref:`AllowPatronToControlAutoRenewal <AllowPatronToControlAutoRenewal-label>` is set to 'Allow patrons', patrons 
will be able to choose whether or not they want their checkouts to be 
renewed automatically. If they choose ‘Yes’, items for which automatic renewal is enabled in the circulation rules will renew as expected. If they choose ‘No’, the automatic renewals that would have applied to this patron’s checkouts will not take place.

|allowautorenewal|

If you have HTML entered in the :ref:`OPACMySummaryHTML <OPACMySummaryHTML-label>`
preference then you will see that to the right of the 'Fines' column.

.. Tip::

   By default, the barcode is not displayed in the patron's checkout table on
   the OPAC. If your patrons would like to see the items barcodes on their list of
   checked out items you can set up a
   :ref:`patron attribute <patron-attribute-types-label>` with the value of
   SHOW\_BCODE and :ref:`authorized value <authorized-values-label>` of YES\_NO.

   |SHOW_BCODEadd|

   Then, on the :ref:`patron's record set the value <editing-patrons-label>` for
   SHOW\_BCODE to 'Yes'.

   |SHOW_BCODEattribute|

   This will add a column to the checkout summary in the OPAC that shows
   the patron the barcodes of the items they have checked out.

If you would like your patrons to leave a note on an item they have checked out
:ref:`AllowCheckoutNotes <allowcheckoutnotes-label>` preference must be set to allow.

In the patron's summary of checkouts, there will be an added column
to allow the patron to leave a note (for example: missing first page, or DVD is
scratched).

|AllowCheckoutNotes|

When the patron clicks on 'Add note', they will be able to write a note about
this checkout.

|checkoutnote|

Staff will be able to :ref:`see and manage checkout notes <checkoutnotes-label>`

or alternatively, if the staff is allowed to change this privacy setting in the
staff interface with the :ref:`AllowStaffToSetCheckoutsVisibilityForGuarantor <AllowStaffToSetCheckoutsVisibilityForGuarantor-label>`
system preference and this setting is turned on, when the guarantor logs in
they will see a tab labeled "Relatives' checkouts" on their summary tab.

|relativecheckouts|

Clicking on the 'Overdue' tab will show only the items that are overdue.

|myoverdues|

The 'Fines' tab will show just a total of what the patron owes. Clicking
on the total will take them to the 'your fines' tab where they will see a
complete breakdown of their fines and bills. If you don't charge fines
at your library you can turn the display of these tabs off by setting
the :ref:`OPACFinesTab <OPACFinesTab-label>` preference to 'Don't allow.'

|mycharges|

If their guarantee has allowed it via :ref:`their privacy <your-privacy-label>`,
or alternatively, if the staff is allowed to change this privacy setting in the
staff interface with the :ref:`AllowStaffToSetFinesVisibilityForGuarantor <AllowStaffToSetFinesVisibilityForGuarantor-label>`
system preference and this setting is turned on, when the guarantor logs in
they will see a tab labeled "Relatives' charges" on their summary tab.

|relativecharges|

The 'Holds' tab shows the patron the status of
all of the items they have on hold.

|myholds|

Depending on the value of the :ref:`SuspendHoldsOpac <SuspendHoldsOpac-label>`
system preference, patrons can suspend their own holds if they are not in
transit or already waiting for them. When they click 'Suspend' they will be
presented with the option to choose a date for their hold to resume.

|suspenduntil|

They can also suspend all of their holds indefinitely or until a
specific date if they choose by filling in the suspend options at the
bottom of the page.

.. Note::

   If the :ref:`AutoResumeSuspendedHolds <AutoResumeSuspendedHolds-label>`
   system preference is set to "Don't allow", patrons will not have the option
   to put an end date on the hold suspension.

From this tab, patrons can also cancel holds. Depending on the
:ref:`waiting hold cancellation policy <defaultwaitingholdcancellationpolicy-label>`,
they may also be able to cancel holds that are already waiting for them.

Depending on the value of the :ref:`OPACAllowUserToChangeBranch <opacallowusertochangebranch-label>`
system preference, the patron may be able to change the pickup library of holds.
When one or more status is selected in the system preference, a 'Change' link
will appear under the current pickup library's name for holds that have that
status.

|myholds-changepickuplibrary|

When the patron clicks on the 'Change' link, there is a pop-up with a selection
of libraries that allow hold pickups.

|myholds-changepickuplibrary-modal|

If your library :ref:`allows recalls<recalls-label>`, the patron can see the
recalls they have requested and their various statuses in the 'Recalls' tab.

|myrecalls|

The patron can cancel a recall by clicking the 'Cancel' button, provided that
it is not already awaiting pickup.

The patron can choose from three options:

-  Forever: keep my reading history without limit. This is the option
   for users who want to keep track of what they are reading.

-  Default: keep my reading history according to local laws. This is the
   default option : the library will keep your reading history for the

Purchase suggestions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If your library has the :ref:`suggestion <suggestion-label>` preference set to 'Allow', patrons
will have the option to make purchase suggestions in several areas in the OPAC.

If you are allowing everyone to see the purchase suggestions made by
others with the :ref:`OPACViewOthersSuggestions <OPACViewOthersSuggestions-label>` preference, there will be a
link at the top of your OPAC under the search box.

|suggestfromsearch|

There will be a link when the patron finds nothing for their search.

|suggestfromnoresults|

There will be a 'Suggest for purchase' option in the detailed view of a
bibliographic record.

|biboptions|

And there will be a link in the
:ref:`Your purchase suggestions <your-purchase-suggestions-label>` tab in the
patron's account.

|suggestfrommyaccount|

Clicking any one of these links will open the purchase suggestion form.

|newsuggestion|

-  The informational text at the top of the form can be replaced using the
   :ref:`HTML customizations tool<html-customizations-label>`, display location
   OpacSuggestionInstructions.

-  From the form only the 'Title' is required by default.

   -  Mandatory fields can be set using the :ref:`OPACSuggestionMandatoryFields <OPACSuggestionMandatoryFields-label>`
      system preference.

-  The :ref:`OPACSuggestionUnwantedFields <OPACSuggestionUnwantedFields-label>` system preference can be used to
   hide unnecessary fields.

-  The :ref:`OPACSuggestionAutoFill <opacsuggestionautofill-label>` system
   preference can be used to help patrons fill out the form using information
   from Google Books.

-  The item type list can be edited by editing the SUGGEST\_FORMAT
   :ref:`authorized value list<authorized-values-label>`.

-  The 'Reason for suggestion' list can be edited by editing the OPAC\_SUG
   :ref:`authorized value list<authorized-values-label>`.

If the item already exists in the catalog, the patron will see a message with
what Koha thinks is the corresponding title. Matches are made on the title/
author, ISBN or ISSN. If the title isn't what the patron is trying to suggest,
they can click 'Confirm your suggestion', to suggest it anyway.

|suggestionmatch|

Once the form is submitted the purchase suggestion will appear in the
:ref:`acquisitions module<managing-purchase-suggestions-label>` for the
librarians to manage.

If a purchase suggestion has been ordered through the
:ref:`acquisitions module<managing-purchase-suggestions-label>`, the patron's
purchase suggestion title will be clickable and bring the patron directly to
the ordered record in the OPAC.

.. _opaclibrariespage-label:

Libraries

Reporting problems
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the :ref:`OPACReportProblem <opacreportproblem-label>` system preference is

links or inaccurate information for example).

At the bottom of each page is a 'Report a problem' link.

|opacmain|

When the patron clicks on the link, they are brought to a form where they can
specify what exactly is the problem.

|reportproblem|

The problem report is sent to the Koha administrator by email (to the address
in :ref:`KohaAdminEmailAddress <KohaAdminEmailAddress-label>`), and will appear
in the :ref:`OPAC problem reports tool <opac-problem-reports-tool>`. If the
:ref:`library <libraries-label>` has an email address, the patron will have the
choice to either send the problem report to the library or to the administrator.

.. Note::

   The notice sent by email is customizable in the
   :ref:`Notices and slips tool <notices-and-slips-label>`. The letter code is
