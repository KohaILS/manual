Reports
=======

Reports in Koha are a way to gather data. Reports are used to generate
statistics, member lists, shelving lists, or any list of data in your
database.

.. _custom-reports-label:

Custom reports
-----------------------------------

Koha's data is stored in a MySQL database which means that librarians
can generate nearly any report they would like by either using the
:ref:`guided reports wizard <guided-report-wizard-label>` or writing their own
:ref:`SQL query <report-from-sql-label>`.

.. _add-custom-report-label:

.. _guided-report-wizard-label:

Guided report wizard
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The guided report wizard will walk you through a six step process to
generate a report.

Step 1: Choose the module you want to report on. This will determine
what tables and fields are available for you to query.

'Report is public' should be left to the default of 'No' in most cases
especially if the report contains patron or other sensitive information.
A public report can be accessed using the
:ref:`JSON reports services <json-reports-services-label>` by anyone and without authentication.

|guidedreportstep1|

    **Note**

    If your system administrator has set up memcache on your server you
    might see one more option for the Cache expiry. This is related to
    your public reports. If you make the report public then it's
    constantly running and will cause a large load on your system.
    Setting this value prevents that.

    |guidedreportcacheexpiry|

Step 2: Choose a report type. For now, Tabular is the only option
available.

|guidedreportstep2|

Step 3: Choose the fields you want in your report. You can select
multiple fields and add them all at once by using CTRL+click on each
item you want to add before clicking the Add button.

|guidedreportstep3|

Step 4: Choose any limits you might want to apply to your report (such
as item types or branches). If you don't want to apply any limits,
simply click 'Next' instead of choosing an option.

|guidedreportstep4|

Step 5: Perform math functions. If you don't want to do any
calculations, simply click 'Next' instead of choosing an option.

|guidedreportstep5|

Step 6: Choose data order. If you want the data to print out in the
order it's found in the database, simply click 'Finish'.

|guidedreportstep6|

When you are finished you will be presented with the SQL generated by
the report wizard. From here you can choose to save the report by
clicking 'Finish' or copy the SQL and make edits to it by hand.

|guidedreportconfirm|

If you choose to save the report you will be asked to name your report,
sort it in to groups and subgroups and enter any notes regarding it.

|guidedreportsave|

Once your report is saved it will appear on the 'Use saved' page with
all other saved reports.

|savedreports|

     **Note**

     -  You can customize the columns of this table in the 
        :ref:`'Table settings'<column-settings-label>` section of the 
        Administration module (table id: table_reports).

From here you can make edits, run the report, or schedule a time to have
the report run. To find the report you created you can sort by any of
the columns by clicking the on the column header (creation date is the
best bet for finding the report you just added). You can also filter
your results using the filter menu on the left or use the tabs to find
reports based on your custom groups.

.. _report-from-sql-label:

Report from SQL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to the report wizard, you have the option to write your own
queries using SQL. To find reports written by other Koha users, visit
the Koha wiki: http://wiki.koha-community.org/wiki/SQL_Reports_Library.
You can also find your database structure in
/installer/data/mysql/kohastructure.sql or online at:
`http://schema.koha-community.org <http://schema.koha-community.org/>`__.

To add your query, click the link to 'Create from SQL' on the main
reports module

|reportsmain|

or the 'New report' button at the top of the 'Saved reports' page.

|newsql|

Fill in the form presented

|reportfromsql|

-  Report name: the name is what will appear on the 'Saved reports' page to help
   you identify the report later. It will also be searchable using the
   filters found on the left of the 'Saved reports' page.

-  Report group: you can use the 'Report group' to organize your reports in
   tabs on the 'Saved reports' page. You can choose from the list of existing
   groups, or create one on the fly by choosing the 'or create' radio button.

   |reportgroup|

   Report groups are set in the REPORT\_GROUP
   :ref:`authorized value category <existing-values-label>`.

   .. Warning::

      If you're adding a report group on the fly, the code should not include
      special characters or spaces.

-  Report subgroup: if you chose a report group, this field will appear to
   further organize your reports. Choose a subgroup from the list, or create
   one on the fly by choosing the 'or create' radio button.

   Report subgroups are set in the REPORT\_SUBGROUP
   :ref:`authorized value category <existing-values-label>`.

   .. Note::

      Report subgroups need to have unique values in 'Authorized value' and
      'Description'. The 'Description (OPAC)' field needs to contain the
      authorized value for the report group that the subgroup falls under.

   .. Warning::

      If you're adding a report subgroup on the fly, the code should not include
      special characters or spaces.

-  Report is public: this should be left to the default of 'No' in most cases,
   especially if the report contains patron or other sensitive information.
   A public report can be accessed using the
   :ref:`JSON reports services <json-reports-services-label>` by anyone and
   without authentication.

-  Cache expiry: this field will only appear if your system administrator has
   set up memcache on your server. This is related to public reports. If you
   make the report public, it's constantly running and will cause a large load
   on your system. Setting this value prevents that.

-  Notes: notes will appear on the 'Saved reports' page, and can be used
   to provide more details about the report or tips on how to enter
   values when it runs.

-  SQL: type or paste the SQL for the report (see
   :ref:`report writing tips <report-writing-tips-label>` below).

Once everything is entered click the 'Save report' button and you'll be
presented with options to run it. From here, you can also
:ref:`edit it <edit-custom-reports-label>`, :ref:`duplicate it <duplicate-report-label>`,
or schedule it to be run later.

Once a report is saved, you do not have to recreate it, it will appear on the
'Saved reports' page with all other saved reports.

|savedreports|

.. Note::

   You can customize the columns of this table in the
   :ref:`'Table settings'<column-settings-label>` section of the
   Administration module (table id: table_reports).

From the 'Saved reports' page, you can :ref:`make edits <edit-custom-reports-label>`,
:ref:`run the report <running-custom-reports-label>`, or schedule a time to
run the report later. To find the report you created, you can sort by any of
the columns by clicking on the column header (creation date is the best to
find the report you just added). You can also filter your results using the
filter menu on the left or use the tabs to find reports based on your custom
groups.

**Autocomplete**

When you start typing in the SQL field, autocomplete options will be displayed.

|reportautocomplete|

Use the arrows on your keyboard to choose the correct option and press 'Enter'
or 'Tab' to insert it into your report, or simply click on the option to insert
it.

Autocomplete options include:

-  SQL keywords such as SELECT, FROM, WHERE, etc.

-  table names

-  column names

   .. Note::

      To have suggestions for column names, you must type the table name first,
      followed by a period, then start typing the column name.

      For example, to have the suggestion for :code:`cardnumber`, you must type
      :code:`borrowers.ca`.

      |reportautocomplete-column|

**Runtime parameters**

If you feel that your report might be too resource intensive you
might want to consider using runtime parameters to your query.
Runtime parameters basically make a filter appear before the report
is run to save your system resources.

Click the button 'Insert runtime parameter' and choose which parameter to add.

|runtimeparameters|

-  Authorized value: will display a drop down menu of the value descriptions
   from the chosen :ref:`authorized value category <authorized-values-label>`.
   The authorized value code will be inserted in the report when it is run.

-  Bibliographic framework: will display a drop down menu of
   :ref:`MARC bibliographic frameworks <marc-bibliographic-frameworks-label>`.
   The framework code will be inserted in the report when it is run.

-  Classification sources: will display a drop down menu of
   :ref:`classification sources <classification-sources-label>`. The
   classification code will be inserted in the report when it is run.

-  Date: will display a calendar to pick a date. The date in YYYY-MM-DD format
   will be inserted in the report when it is run.

-  Item types: will display a drop down menu of
   :ref:`item types <item-types-label>`. The item type code will be inserted in
   the report when it is run.

-  Libraries: will display a drop down menu of :ref:`libraries <libraries-label>`.
   The library code (branchcode) will be inserted in the report when it is run.

-  List: will display a large text box in which the user can enter many values,
   one per line. Those values will be inserted in the report, separated by
   commas, when it is run.

   .. Warning::

      In the case of the list parameter, users must write one value per line.

-  Patron categories: will display a drop down menu of
   :ref:`patron categories <patron-categories-label>`. The category code will
   be inserted in the report when it is run.

-  Cash registers: will display a drop down menu of
   :ref:`cash registers <cashregisters-label>`. The cash register's internal id
   will be inserted in the report when it is run.

-  Debit types: will display a drop down menu of
   :ref:`debit types <debit-types-label>`. The debit type code will be inserted
   in the report when it is run.

-  Credit types: will display a drop down menu of
   :ref:`credit types <credit-types-label>`. The credit type code will be
   inserted in the report when it is run.

-  Text field: will display an empty text field in which the user can enter any
   text.

   .. Note::

      You have to put "%" in a text box to 'leave it blank'. Otherwise,
      it literally looks for "" (empty string) as the value for the
      field.

      For example entering nothing for: "title=<<Enter title>>" will
      display results with title='' (no title).

      If you want to have to have something not mandatory, use
      "title like <<Enter title>>" and enter a % at run time instead
      of nothing.

After you choose the type of runtime parameter, it will ask you for the parameter
label. This is what the user will see as the label for the choice they have to
make or text they have to enter.

The syntax inserted into the report is :code:`<<Label\|authorized\_value>>`.

-  The << and >> are just delimiters to indicate the start and end of the
   runtime parameter.

-  The label will be displayed on the left of the choice or value to enter.

-  The authorized\_value can be omitted if not applicable. If it is absent, a
   free text field will be displayed. If it contains an authorized code (see
   table below), a drop down of the values will be displayed.

.. Note::

   You can write those in manually as well, you don't have to go through the
   'Insert runtime parameter' button. As long as the syntax is correct, Koha
   will interpret it as a runtime parameter.

Report dictionary

to apply to your reports. This is a good way to add in filters that the
report wizard doesn't include by default. To add a new definition, or
filter, click 'New definition' on the reports dictionary page and follow
the 4 step process.

Step 1: Name the definition and provide a description if necessary

Confirm your selections to save the definition.

Your definitions will all appear on the Reports Dictionary page
