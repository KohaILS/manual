Patrons
===============================================================================

Before importing or adding patrons be sure to set up your 
:ref:`patron categories <patron-categories-label>`.

.. _add-a-new-patron-label:

Add a new patron
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Patrons are added by going to the 'Patrons' module.

-  *Get there:* Patrons

Once there you can add a new patron.

-  Click 'New patron'

   |newpatron|

.. Note::

   The fields that appear on the patron add form can be controlled by
   editing the :ref:`BorrowerUnwantedField <BorrowerUnwantedField-label>`
   system preference.

.. Note::

   Required fields are defined in the
   :ref:`BorrowerMandatoryField <BorrowerMandatoryField-label>` system
   preference

-  First, enter the identifying information regarding your patron

   |patronidentity|

   -  'Salutation' is populated by the
      :ref:`BorrowersTitles <BorrowersTitles-label>` system preference

      .. Note::

         If you'd like to prevent full names from printing on
         :ref:`slips <notices-and-slips-label>` and you're not using the Initials or
         Other name fields for anything else, you can use them for
         shortened versions of the name to then be printed on the slip.

          For example:

          ::

              Firstname: Nicole C.
              Surname: Engard
              Initials: NCE

          Then on the slip you can have it print the
          <<borrowers.initials>> instead of the full name (NCE).

          Or you could do something like this:

          ::

              Firstname: Nicole
              Surname: Engard
              Initials: E

          Then on the slip you can have it print the
          <<borrowers.initials>>, <<borrowers.firstname>> instead of the
          full name (E, Nicole).

-  If this patron is a child, you will be asked to attach the child
   patron to an adult patron (guarantor)

   |addGuarantor|

   .. Note::

      Guarantors can only be attached to patrons whose :ref:`category <patron-categories-label>`
      has 'Can be guarantee' set to 'Yes'.

   -  If the guarantor is a patron of the library, click 'Add guarantor' to 
      search your system for an existing patron

      |addGuarantor2|

   -  Click 'Select' to choose the patron

      |addGuarantor3|

   -  The relationships are set using the
      :ref:`borrowerRelationship <borrowerRelationship-label>` system preference

      |addGuarantor4|

      .. Note::

         It is possible to add more than one guarantor to a patron account
         (both parents for example).

   -  If the guarantor is not a patron, you can still add their information in 
      the 'Non-patron guarantor' section.

-  Next enter the main address and contact information

   |addmainaddress|

   .. Note::

      The street type drop-down menu is populated by the ROADTYPE
      :ref:`authorized values <existing-values-label>`

   |addcontact|

   -  For contact information, note that the primary phone number and primary 
      email address are the ones that appear on notices and slips printed
      during circulation (receipts, transfer slips and hold slips). The
      primary email is also the one that overdue notices and other
      messages go to.

   -  The 'Main contact method' can be used in reports and for staff to know
      which method to use first when trying to contact the patron.

-  You can also record an alternate address for each patron. This could be used 
   in an academic setting to store the patron's home address for example.

   |addaltaddress|

-  Each patron can have an alternate contact. An alternate contact could be a 
   parent or guardian, for example.

   |addaltcontact|

-  The library management section includes values that are used within
   the library

   |addlibmanagement|

   -  The card number field is automatically calculated if you have the
      :ref:`autoMemberNum <autoMemberNum-label>` system preference set that way

      .. Note::

         For a newly installed system, this preference will start at 1 and
         increment by 1 each time after. To have it start with the starting
         number of your barcodes, enter the first barcode by hand in the patron
         record and save the patron. After that, the field will increment that
         number by 1.

   -  If you accidentally chose the wrong patron category at the
      beginning you can fix that here

   -  Sort 1 and 2 are used for statistical purposes within your library

      -  You can create drop-down menus for these fields by adding values 
         in the Bsort1 and Bsort2 :ref:`authorized values categories <existing-values-label>`

   -  'Allow auto-renewal of items' is used to control whether this patron’s
      checkouts will be renewed according to the circulation rules. If set to
      ‘Yes’, items for which automatic renewal is enabled in the circulation
      rules will be automatically renewed. This requires the
      :ref:`automatic_renewal cronjob <cron-automatic-renewal-label>` to run
      daily. If set to ‘No’, items for which automatic renewal is enabled in the
      circulation rules will not be automatically renewed.

   -  Protected: protected patrons cannot be deleted either manually or by batch.
      Use this for system patrons such as
      :ref:`statistical patrons <add-a-statistical-patron-label>`,
      :ref:`SIP2 patrons <sip2-label>`, the
      :ref:`self checkout user <self-checkout-label>`, or superadmins.

      .. Admonition:: Version

         The 'Protected' option is available from Koha version 23.11.

   -  'Check for previous checkouts' is used to set the patron's personal 
      preference regarding checking their circulation history to see if they 
      have borrowed This item in the past. This overrides the setting of the 
      :ref:`patron category <adding-a-patron-category-label>` and of the 
      :ref:`CheckPrevCheckout <CheckPrevCheckout-label>` system preference.

-  Next, the library set-up section includes additional library settings

   |addlibsetup|

   -  The registration date will automatically be filled in with today's
      date

   -  The expiry date will automatically be calculated based on your 
      :ref:`patron category settings <patron-categories-label>`

   -  The OPAC note is a note for the patron, it will appear in the patron's 
      online account on the OPAC

      |opacnote|

      .. Note::

         See also :ref:`OPAC messages <opac-messages-label>`

   -  The Circulation note is meant solely for your library staff and
      will appear when the circulation staff goes to check an item out
      to the patron

      |circnote|

-  The 'OPAC/Staff interface login' section asks for the username and 
   password to be used by the patron (or staff member) to log into their 
   account in the OPAC and for staff to log in to the staff interface.

   -  Staff will only be able to use this login information to log in to
      the staff interface if they have at least the 
      :ref:`catalogue permission <patron-permissions-label>`.

-  If you have enabled the housebound module (with the :ref:`HouseboundModule <HouseboundModule-label>` 
   system preference), you will be able to choose a 
   :ref:`housebound role <housebound-patrons-label>` for this patron.

   |addhouseboundroles|

-  If you have set :ref:`additional patron attributes <patron-attribute-types-label>` 
   in the administration module, these will appear next

   |addattributes|

-  Finally, if you have the :ref:`EnhancedMessagingPreferences <EnhancedMessagingPreferences-label>` system 
   preference set to 'allow,' you can choose the messaging preferences for 
   this patron.

   |addpatronmsg|

   See the definition of each notice in the 
   :ref:`advance notices and hold notices <advance-notices-and-hold-notices-label>`
   section

   .. Warning::

      These preferences will override any you set via the
      :ref:`patron categories <adding-a-patron-category-label>`

   .. Warning::

      These preferences can be altered by the patron via the OPAC if the
      :ref:`EnhancedMessagingPreferencesOPAC <EnhancedMessagingPreferencesOPAC-label>`
      system preference is set to 'show'.

-  Once finished, click 'Save'

If the system suspects this patron is a duplicate of another it will warn you.

|duplicatewarn|

.. Note::

   See the :ref:`PatronDuplicateMatchingAddFIelds <PatronDuplicateMatchingAddFIelds-label>`
   system preference to see or change which fields are used to detect duplicate
   patrons. The default is the surname, the firstname and the date of birth.

If you have set a minimum or upper age limit on the patron category and
are requiring that the birth date be filled in, Koha will warn you if
the patron you're adding is too old or young for the patron category you
have selected:

|patronagelimit|

If the patron's :ref:`category <patron-categories-label>` has an enrollment 
fee, the fee will be charged to the patron's account when the account is 
created. You can then manage the charge in the patron's :ref:`accounting tab <fines-label>`.

.. _quick-add-patron-label:

Quick add a patron
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your circulation desk is very busy and you want to register patron quickly,
you can use the 'quick add' feature. It's a shortened version of the add
patron form with only a couple of necessary fields to fill out.

This feature uses two system preferences: :ref:`BorrowerMandatoryField <BorrowerMandatoryField-label>`
and :ref:`PatronQuickAddFields <PatronQuickAddFields-label>`. These are the two system preferences that
control which fields are in the quick add form.

To quick add a patron, go to the Patrons module

-  *Get there:* Patrons

Click on the 'Quick add new patron' button.

You will be asked to choose a patron category.

Then, you will be presented with a shortened form.

|add_patron|

Once the form is filled out, click on 'Save'.

If you need to access the full form, you can click on 'Show full form'
above the 'Save' button.

.. _add-a-staff-patron-label:

Add a staff patron
----------------------------------------

All staff members must be entered into Koha as patrons of the 'Staff'
type. Follow the steps in :ref:`Add a Patron <add-a-new-patron-label>` to add a
staff member. To give the staff member permissions to access the staff
client, follow the steps in :ref:`patron permissions <patron-permissions-label>`

    **Important**

    Remember to assign your staff secure usernames and passwords since
    these will be used to log into the staff client.

.. _add-a-statistical-patron-label:

Add a statistical patron
----------------------------------------------

One way to track use of in house items is to "check out" the materials
to a statistical patron. The "check out" process doesn’t check the book
out, but instead tracks an in house use of the item. To use this method
for tracking in house use you first will need a :ref:`patron
category <patron-categories-label>` set up for your statistical patron.

|image420|

Next, you will need to create a new patron of the statistical type.

|add_statistical_patron|

Next, follow the steps put forth in the ':ref:`Add a new
patron <add-a-new-patron-label>`' section of this manual. Since this patron is
not a real person, simply fill in the required fields, the correct
library and nothing else.

To learn about other methods of tracking in house use visit the
:ref:`tracking inhouse use <tracking-in-house-use-label>` section of this manual.

.. _duplicate-a-patron-label:

Duplicate a patron
-----------------------------------------

Sometimes when you're adding a new family to your system you don't want
to type the contact information over and over. Koha allows for you to
duplicate a patron and change only the parts you want to (or need to)
change.

-  Open the patron you want to use as your base (the patron you want to
   duplicate information from)

-  Click the 'Duplicate' button at the top of their record

   |patronedit|

-  All of the fields with the exception of first name, card number,
   username and password have been duplicated. Fill in the missing
   pieces and click 'Save'

   |duplicate|

   -  **Note**

          Clicking in a field that is already populated with data will
          clear that field of all information (making it easier for you
          to type in something different)

-  You will be brought to your new patron

   |duplicated_patron|

.. _add-patron-images-label:

Adding patron images
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can add patron pictures to help identify patrons. To enable this feature,
you must first set the :ref:`patronimages <patronimages-label>` system
preference to 'Allow'.

If the preference is set to 'Allow', you will see a placeholder image
under the patron's name on the left of the screen.

|patronimageempty|

Click the 'Add' button on the placeholder image.

|addpatronimage|

You have the option of either uploading an existing picture from the computer
or taking a picture with the webcam.

To upload an existing image, click 'Browse' or 'Choose file' to find the image
on your computer and click 'Upload' to load the image in the patron's file.

.. Warning::

   There is a limit of 100K on the size of the picture uploaded and it
   is recommended that the image be 200x300 pixels, but smaller images
   will work as well.

To take a picture with the webcam, click the 'Take photo' button once the webcam
is facing the patron. The system will take a picture and present it to you for
review. If you are satisfied, click 'Upload'. If not, click 'Retake photo' to
take a new picture. You can also download the picture by clicking 'Download
photo'.

To add patron images in bulk, use the
:ref:`Upload patron images <upload-patron-images-label>` tool.

.. _editing-patrons-label:

Editing patrons
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Patrons in Koha can be edited using one of many edit buttons.

-  To edit the entire patron record simply click the 'Edit' button at
   the top of the patron record.

   |patronedit|

-  To edit a specific section of the patron record (for example the
   'Library use' section) click the 'Edit' button beside the section.

   |libraryusesection|

Edit the patron's file and click 'Save'.

.. _patron-password-label:

Modifying patron passwords
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Patron passwords are not recoverable.

The stars on the patron details page next to the password label are always there
even if a password isn't set.

If a patron forgets their password, the only option is to reset their password.

This can be done from the staff interface. To change the patron's password,
click the 'Change password' button.

|patronpassword|

-  Koha cannot display existing passwords as they are encrypted in the database.
   Leave the field blank to leave password unchanged.

-  This form can automatically generate a random password if you click the link
   labeled "Click to fill with a randomly generated suggestion. Passwords will
   be displayed as text."

Changing the password through this form will also update the password expiry
date, as set in the :ref:`patron category<patron-categories-label>`.

If the :ref:`NotifyPasswordChange <notifypasswordchange-label>` system
preference is enabled, the patron will receive a notification indicating their
password was changed.

.. Note::

   The content of this email can be customized with the
   :ref:`Notices and slips tool <notices-and-slips-label>`. The code of the letter
   is PASSWORD\_CHANGE.

If the :ref:`OpacResetPassword <opacresetpassword-label>` system preference is
enabled, or if the :ref:`patron category <patron-categories-label>` allows it,
you can also send a password reset email to the patron by clicking on 'More' and
choosing 'Send password reset'.

|moremenu|

This will send a password reset email to the patron, similar to the one sent if
they click on the :ref:`'Forgot your password?' <resetting-your-password-label>`
link on the OPAC. However, the reset link is set to expire after 5 days rather
than 2 days when it is sent this way.

.. Note::

   The content of the email can be customized with the
   :ref:`Notices and slips tool <notices-and-slips-label>`. The code of the
   letter is STAFF\_PASSWORD\_RESET.

Only staff members with 'superlibrarian' permissions can see and change the
password expiry date manually. This date can be changed by clicking the 'Edit'
button at the top of the patron's record, or the 'Edit' button next to the
'Library use' section.

.. _add-patron-flags-label:

Adding patron flags
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Restrictions <patron-restrictions-label>` are used to prevent patrons from
checking out.

Patrons can also be blocked from checking items out by setting patron flags.

|patronflags|

If you would like your circulation staff to confirm a patron's address before
checking items out to the patron, set the 'Gone no address' flag. This will
create a warning when checking out.

|addresswarning|

If the patron reports that they have lost their card you can set the 'Lost card'
flag to prevent someone else from using that card to check items out.

|lostcardwarning|

If you would like to bar a patron from the library you can add a manual
restriction.

|addpatronrestriction|

.. Note::

   This is the same as the :ref:`restrictions tab <patron-restrictions-label>`
   at the bottom of the patrons details page.

.. Note::

   A patron can automatically be restricted with the
   :ref:`Overdue/notice status triggers <overdue-notice/status-triggers-label>`

If you enter in a date and/or note related to the restriction, you will see that
in the restricted message as well.

|patronrestrictions-checkout|

.. _internal-messages-label:

Adding notes and messages to a patron record
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can leave notes in a patron record. There are several ways to do this:
you can either add a circulation note or an internal message. These will not
show in the OPAC for the patron to see. If you want the patron to see the notes
and messages, use :ref:`OPAC notes <opac-notes-label>` and
:ref:`OPAC messages <opac-messages-label>`.

.. _circulation-notes-label:

Circulation notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Circulation notes are added to the patron's file through the
:ref:`add patron form<add-a-new-patron-label>` or the
:ref:`edit patron form <editing-patrons-label>`, in the 'Library set-up'
section.

|addlibsetup|

In the staff interface, circulation notes will be in the 'Library use' section
of the patron's file.

|libraryusesection|

.. _circulation-messages-label:

Circulation messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Internal messages are added to the patron's file using the 'Add message' button.

|patronedit|

To leave an internal message, choose "Staff - Internal note" in the 'Add a
message for' field. Enter your message in the box, or choose a predefined
message in the drop-down menu.

|internalnote|

.. Note::

   Predefined messages are added in the BOR\_NOTES
   :ref:`authorized value category <existing-values-label>`

Once saved, the internal message is shown in bold red on the patron's detail
page in the staff interface, at the top of the page just under the row of action
buttons.

|internalnote2|

It will also appear on the checkout page, to the right of the checkout box.

|internalnote3|

If you need to edit the message, click the 'Edit' button next to the message,
edit the text and click 'Save'.

.. _change-child-to-adult-label:

Changing children to adults
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Children patrons do not become adults automatically in Koha unless the
:ref:`update patron categories <cron-update-patron-categories-label>` cron job
is running.

To upgrade a child patron to and adult patron category manually go to the 'More'
menu and choose 'Update child to adult patron'.

|moremenu|

You will then be presented with a pop up window asking which one of your adult
patron categories this child should be updated to.

|chooseadultcategory|

.. Note::

   This list shows the :ref:`patron categories <patron-categories-label>` that
   have the category type 'adult'.

.. _renew-patron-account-label:

Renew patron account
----------------------------------

When renewing a patron account you can either edit the the expiry date
manually in the patron record or use the 'Renew patron' option from the
More menu in the toolbar at the top.

|image1393|

Using the latter the new expiry date will be calculated using the
enrollment period configured for the patron category of the user.
The system preference :ref:`BorrowerRenewalPeriodBase <BorrowerRenewalPeriodBase-label>` determines if
the new expiry date will be calculated from the current date or from the
old expiry date.

One advantage of using the 'Renew patron' option is that it will be logged
as a membership renewal in the action_logs table and be visible as such
when using the :ref:`Log viewer <log-viewer-label>` or the
:ref:`Modificaton log <modification-log-label>` from the patron account.

The renewal date of the patron account will be visible on the details tab.

|image1392|

If the patron is in a :ref:`patron category <patron-categories-label>` with a 
membership fee, the charge will also be added upon renewal. You can then manage 
the charge in the patron's :ref:`accounting tab <fines-label>`.

.. _delete-patron-account-label:

Deleting a patron account
----------------------------------

From the 'More' drop-down, the patron account can be deleted. 

|image1469|

There will be an alert if the patron has checkouts, holds, fines or credits. 

-  If a patron has current checkouts, the deletion will not be possible. 

   |image1470|

-  If a patron has outstanding fines, the deletion will not be possible.

   |image1468|

-  If a patron has unused credits, the option to delete the patron is possible 
   but there will be a warning.

   |image1471|

-  If a patron has existing holds on their account, the option to delete the 
   patron is possible. The hold will be cancelled and moved to the old\_reserves 
   table. 

   |image1462|

-  If a patron has public or shared :ref:`lists <lists-label>`, those will be
   deleted along with the patron, unless the
   :ref:`ListOwnershipUponPatronDeletion <listownershipuponpatrondeletion-label>`
   system preference is set to 'change owner of these lists'.

-  If a patron is protected, the 'Delete' option will be disabled. To delete the
   patron anyway, :ref:`edit the patron <editing-patrons-label>` and choose
   'No' under 'Protected' in the 'Library management' section, save, and
   then delete.

   |deletepatronprotected|

.. _managing-patron-self-edits-label:

Managing patron self edits
--------------------------------------------------

If you are allowing patrons to edit their accounts via the OPAC with the
:ref:`OPACPatronDetails <OPACPatronDetails-label>` preference then you will need
to approve all changes via the staff client before they're applied. If
there are patron edits awaiting action they will appear on the staff
client dashboard below the modules list (along with other items awaiting
action).

|image438|

    **Note**

    Superlibrarians will see modifications for any branch, other staff
    will only see modifications for patrons who belong to their logged
    in branch.

When you click the 'Patrons requesting modifications' link you will be
brought to a list of patrons with requested changes.

|image439|

From here you can 'Approve' and apply the changes to the patron record,
'Delete' and remove the changes or 'Ignore' and keep the changes pending
to review later.

If you would like to see the entire patron record you can click the
'Patron details' links to the right of the buttons. This will open in a
new tab.

Merging patron records
-----------------------------------

If you accidentally end up with one patron with two cards it is possible
to merge their records together so that you don't lose their loan history
or holds.

-  In the patron list, check the boxes next to the records you want to
   merge and click on the 'Merge selected patrons' button.

|image1326|

    **Note**

    It is possible to merge more than two records at a time.

-  Select the patron record you want to keep

   |image1327|


-  If necessary, click the 'Compare patrons' button to see the differences 
   between the different accounts.

   |mergepatrons-compare|

-  Click the 'Merge patrons' button.

The checkouts and statistics will be transferred to the right record and
the other one will be deleted.

|image1328|

.. _patron-permissions-label:

Patron permissions
-------------------------------------------

Patron permissions are used to allow staff members access to the staff
client.

    **Important**

    In order for a staff member to log into the staff interface they
    must have (at the very least) 'catalogue' permissions which allow
    them to view the staff interface.

.. _setting-patron-permissions-label:

Setting patron permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  On the patron record click 'More' and choose 'Set permissions' to alter
   patron permissions

   |image440|

-  You will be presented with a list of preferences, some of which can
   be expanded by clicking the 'Show details' link on the right
   title.

   |image441|

-  In all cases, if the parent permission is checked, the user has all the
   child permissions. If you want to set permissions on a more granular level,
   expand the section and only check the permissions you want that user to
   have.


.. _patron-permissions-defined-label:

|patronrestrictions-none|

If the patron has restrictions on their account the tab will show the
number and the description.

There are at least four kinds of restrictions:
  - Manual
  - Overdues
  - Suspension
  - Discharge

Using the 'Add manual restriction' link you can add a restriction to
the patron record from here. This can be used for any type of restriction
you need to put manually on a patron record.

|addrestriction|

-  Type: if the :ref:`PatronRestrictionTypes <patronrestrictiontypes-label>`
   system preference is enabled, you will have a choice of restriction types.
   This list can be managed from the 
   :ref:`patron restriction types administration page <patron-restriction-types-label>`

-  Comment: enter a comment to explain the restriction

-  Expiration: optionally enter an expiration date for this restriction. If
   there is no expiration date, the restriction will stay on the file until it
   is removed. If there is an expiration date, the restriction will
   automatically be removed.

|patronrestrictions|

The overdues restrictions are automatically set when overdue notices are sent
if you specified you wanted the patron restricted in the
:ref:`overdue notice/status triggers tool <overdue-notice/status-triggers-label>`.

This restriction will not be removed automatically when the overdue items are
returned unless the :ref:`AutoRemoveOverduesRestrictions <AutoRemoveOverduesRestrictions-label>` system preference
is set to 'Do'.

In the :ref:`circulation rules <circulation-and-fines-rules-label>`, you can choose
to fine users by suspending them instead of (or in addition to) fining them money.
In that case, returning an overdue document will trigger a suspension restriction.

Patrons may also be restricted if you have issued a
:ref:`discharge <patron-discharges-label>` for them. Once the discharge is
validated, the patron is automatically restricted.

Patrons can also be restricted by
:ref:`setting flags in their accounts <add-patron-flags-label>`.

Restrictions on a patron record will block checkouts. In fact,
a message will appear in red when going to the checkout page.

|patronrestrictions-checkout|

Restrictions may also prevent renewing items if the :ref:`RestrictionBlockRenewing <RestrictionBlockRenewing-label>`
system preference is set to 'block'.

On the OPAC, patrons will get a message saying their account is frozen. They will
not be able to place holds from the OPAC.

|frozenaccount|

If you have patrons that have more than one restriction, you can choose to
cumulate their restriction periods or not through the
:ref:`CumulativeRestrictionPeriods <CumulativeRestrictionPeriods-label>` system preference.

.. Note::

   If you want to restrict patrons from doing various actions if their record
   is not pristine, check the following system preferences:

   - Set the :ref:`OverduesBlockCirc <OverduesBlockCirc-label>` system preference to 'Block' to prevent
     patrons who have overdue materials from checking out other materials.
   - Set the :ref:`OverduesBlockRenewing <OverduesBlockRenewing-label>` system preference to 'block renewing
     for all the patron's items' or 'block renewing only for this item' to prevent
     patrons who have overdue materials from renewing their loans.
   - Enter values in the :ref:`noissuescharge <noissuescharge-label>` and :ref:`NoIssuesChargeGuarantees <NoIssuesChargeGuarantees-label>`
     system preferences in order to block checking out to patrons who have more
     than a certain amount in fines or to patrons whose guarantees owe more than
     a certain amount.
   - Enter a value in the :ref:`maxoutstanding <maxoutstanding-label>` system preference to prevent
     patron from placing holds on the OPAC if they owe more than a certain amount.
   - Enter a value in the :ref:`OPACFineNoRenewals <OPACFineNoRenewals-label>` system preference to prevent
     patron who owe more than a certain amount to renew their loans from the OPAC.
   - Set the :ref:`BlockExpiredPatronOpacActions <BlockExpiredPatronOpacActions-label>` system preference to 'Block' if
     you want to prevent patron whose membership has expired to place hold or
     renew their loans from the OPAC.

Clubs
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

If you use :ref:`patron clubs <patron-clubs-label>`, patrons will have a tab
in their record indicating which club they are enrolled in, if any. The first
number in the tab title is the number of clubs in which the patron is enrolled,

.. _two-factor-authentication-staff-label:

Two factor authentication in the staff interface
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Koha offers two-factor authentication (2FA) for logging into the staff interface.

This two-factor authentication uses a time-based one-time password (TOTP). A
TOTP is a password can only be used once and is only valid for a limited time.

Users wanting to use the two-factor authentication must have an app to generate
these TOTPs. Any authenticator app, such as Google Authenticator, andOTP,
FreeOTP and many others can be used. Applications that enable backup of their
2FA accounts (either cloud-based or automatic) are recommended.

Turn on the two-factor authentication with the :ref:`TwoFactorAuthentication <TwoFactorAuthentication-label>`
system preference.

Once this is done, the staff user must go to their account by clicking their
username at the top of the page and clicking 'My account'.

|myaccount|

The user must then go to More > Manage two-factor authentication.

|manage2fa|

The status should be 'Disabled' when first going to this page.

|manage2fa-disabled|

Click on 'Enable two-factor authentication'.

A QR code will be presented. This code must be scanned with an authenticator
app (see above for suggestions).

|manage2fa-qrcode|

.. Note::

   If the app doesn't allow to scan QR codes, the page gives the credentials
   that can be entered manually (account, key, time-based).

Once the QR code is scanned, the app will return a time-based PIN code. The user
must enter this PIN code in the PIN code field and click 'Register with
two-factor app'.

The status of the two-factor authentication will now be enabled.

.. Note::

   An email will be sent to the user's email address to alert them that the
   two-factor authentication has been enabled on their account.

   You can customize this message in the :ref:`Notices and slips tool <notices-and-slips-label>`.
   The letter code is 2FA\_ENABLE.

When this user tries to log in to the staff interface, they will have to enter
their username and password, like always, but also a two-factor authentication
code.

|2falogincode|

The user must then open their authenticator app, generate a time-based
one-time password and enter it in the field in order to log in.

.. Note::

   Alternatively, if the user doesn't have the app handy, they can click on
   'Send the code by email', which will send them an email with a time-based
   one-time password for them to use.

   The email is based on the 2FA\_OTP\_TOKEN notice template, which can be
   customized in the :ref:`Notices and slips tool <notices-and-slips-label>`.

Should the user wish to disable their two-factor authentication, they can go to
their account in the staff interface, click More > Manage two-factor
authentication and click 'Disable two-factor authentication'.

|manage2fa-enabled|

.. Note::

   An email will be sent to the user's email address to alert them that the
   two-factor authentication has been disabled on their account.

   You can customize this message in the :ref:`Notices and slips tool <notices-and-slips-label>`.
   The letter code is 2FA\_DISABLE.

|image480|

You can also browse through the patron records by clicking on the linked
letters across the top.
