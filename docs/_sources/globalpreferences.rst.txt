System preferences
===============================================================================

System preferences control the way your Koha system works in
general. Set these preferences before anything else in Koha.

-  *Get there:* More > Administration > System preferences

System preferences can be searched (using any part of the preference
name or description) using the search box on the 'Administration' page

|prefsearch|

or the search box at the top of the administration module or system preferences
pages.

|searchbar-admin|

When editing system preferences a *(modified)* flag will appear next to elements
that were changed until you click the 'Save all ... preferences' button.

|saveallprefs|

After saving your preferences you'll get a confirmation message telling
you what preferences were saved.

|saveconfirmation|

Each section of system preferences is sorted alphabetically by default. Clicking
the small 'up' arrow to the right of the word 'Preference' in the header
column will invert the sorting.

|sortprefs|

If the system preference refers to monetary values (
:ref:`maxoutstanding <maxoutstanding-label>`, for example) the currency
displayed will be the default one set in the
:ref:`currencies and exchange rates <currencies-and-exchange-rates-label>`
administration section.

.. Warning::

   For library systems with unique URLs for each site the system
   preference can be overridden by editing your koha-http.conf file.
   This has to be done by a system administrator or someone with access
   to your system files. For example, if all libraries but one want to
   have search terms highlighted in results, set the
   :ref:`OpacHighlightedWords <opachighlightedwords-and-nothighlightedwords-label>`
   system preference to 'Highlight', then edit the koha-http.conf for the
   library that wants this turned off by adding
   :code:`SetEnv OVERRIDE\_SYSPREF\_OpacHighlightedWords "0"`. After
   restarting the web server, that one library will no longer see
   highlighted terms. Consult with your system administrator for more
   information.
