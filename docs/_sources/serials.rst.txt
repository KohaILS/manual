Serials
===============================================================================

Serials actions can be accessed by going to the 'More' menu at the top of
your screen and choosing 'Serials' or by clicking 'Serials' on the main Koha
staff interface page. The serials module in Koha is used for keeping track
of journals, newspapers and other items that come on a regular schedule.

As with all modules, make sure you go through the related
:ref:`implementation checklist <serials-configuration-label>` and 
:ref:`system preferences<serials-system-preferences-label>` before using the 
serials module.

Managing serial frequencies
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Koha keeps a record of publication frequencies for easy management and
duplication.

-  *Get there:* More > Serials > Manage frequencies

From this page you can view all of the existing frequencies in your system.

You can edit, delete and create new ones.

.. _adding-serial-frequency-label:

Adding a frequency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add a new frequency, click on the 'New frequency' button.

|newfrequency|

-  Description: this is the name that will appear in the drop-down menu
   when creating a new serial subscription; make sure it is descriptive

-  Unit: this is the unit used for counting the cycle of publication. Choose
   either none (for irregular frequencies), day, week, month, or year.

-  Issues per unit: this is how many issues are published during the unit chosen
   above (this will usually be 1).

-  Units per issue: this is how many units must we count until the next issue
   is published.

-  Display order: this is the display order in the drop-down menu when
   :ref:`creating a new subscription<add-a-subscription-label>` (you may want
   to put the most used frequencies at the top and the less frequent at the
   bottom; the top-most position is 0). Several frequencies can have the same
   display order value. If this is the case, they will appear in the order they
   were created.

.. Tip::

  To understand 'issues per unit' versus 'units per issue' you can read it as
  '<*issues* per unit> issue(s) every <*units* per issues> <unit>'. For example, a
  biweekly frenquency (every two weeks) would be '1 issue every 2 weeks'. So
  'issues per unit' would be 1 and 'units per issue' would be 2. See below for
  more examples.

**Examples**

Here are some examples for most common serial publication frequencies.

+------------------------------------------------+---------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| Frequency                                      | Unit          | Issues per unit | Units per issue |

Manage serial numbering patterns
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every time you create a new numbering pattern in serials you can save it
for later use. These patterns are accessible via the 'Manage numbering
patterns' page.

-  *Get there:* More > Serials > Manage numbering patterns

This page will list for you the numbering patterns you have saved in the
past as well as a few basic patterns.

|numpatterns|

.. Note::
   If you have upgraded from an old version of Koha (before 3.14) you will see
   'Backup patterns' listed for patterns. This is how Koha saved your old
   numbering patterns. You can edit these to give them more meaningful names
   from here.

.. _adding-serial-numbering-pattern-label:

Adding a numbering pattern
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To add new new pattern click the 'New numbering pattern' button.

|newnumpattern|

-  Name: this is the name that will appear in the drop-down menu
   when :ref:`creating a new serial subscription<add-a-subscription-label>`;
   make sure it is descriptive.

-  Description: this is to further describe the numbering pattern; this does
   not appear when creating a new subscription, it only displays in the
   :ref:`numbering patterns table (see above)<manage-serial-numbering-patterns-label>`.

-  Numbering formula: this is what is used to create the number for each issue.
   You can use up to three variables {X}, {Y}, and {Z} (see below). Along with
   the variables, you can enter any text you want to have appear in the issue
   number. You must also include any spaces you want to see in the issue numbers.
   The text will stay the same for each issue and the variables will vary.

   .. Warning::

      The variables must be in capital letters and between curly brackets.

      **Examples**

      -  Vol. {X} No {Y}

      -  Issue {X}

      -  {X} {Y}

-  Display order: this is the display order in the drop-down menu when
   :ref:`creating a new subscription<add-a-subscription-label>` (you may want
   to put the most used frequencies at the top and the less frequent at the
   bottom; the top-most position is 0). Several frequencies can have the same
   display order value. If this is the case, they will appear in the order they
   were created.

In the table, you need to enter the parameters for each variable.

-  Label: this is simply a name for the variable, it is not
   used anywhere else, but it helps identify what the variable is supposed
   to be.

-  Add: how many numbers or units are added to the variable.

-  Each: the numbers or units added to the variable are added each how many
   issues.

-  Set back to: this is used for cyclic numbering; enter the starting number.

-  When more than: this is used for cyclic numbering; enter the last number.

.. Tip::

  When filling out these four parameter ('add', 'each', 'set back to' and 'when
  more than'), work column by column and read it as a sentence: "Add 1 Every 1
  issue, set back to 1 when greater than 10".

-  Formatting: this is used if, instead of numbers, you want words to appear
   in your issue number. You can choose

     -  Name of day (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc.)

     -  Name of day (abbreviated) (Mon, Tue, Wed, etc.)

     -  Name of month (January, February, March, etc.)

     -  Name of month (abbreviated) (Jan, Feb, Mar, etc.)

     -  Name of season (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter)

     -  Name of season (abbreviated) (Spr, Sum, Fal, Win)

.. Warning::

   When filling out the table, you must always use numbers, even to represent
   names of days, months or seasons. Here are the equivalent for each

Before you save your numbering pattern, you can test it to make sure it
behaves as you intend.

-  Frequency: choose a frequency that fits with your numbering pattern.

-  First issue publication date: choose a date where your test will start.

-  Subscription length: enter a number of issues, weeks or months to test
   your numbering pattern; if the numbering pattern is cyclic, it is
   recommended to try at least two cycles to see the change in cycles and
   make sure it behaves correctly.

-  Locale: if using names of days, months or season, you can choose the
   language in which these names will be displayed.

   .. Note::

     Locale doesn't currently work well with season names.

Next enter the parameters for your variables.

-  Begins with: enter the first value for each variable, these should be the
   values of the issue entered in 'First issue publication date' above.

-  Inner counter: enter how many issues have already passed in the cycle, so
   that Koha can calculate when to cycle back.

Click 'Test pattern' to see the results. If the result is what you expected,
you can save your numbering pattern. If the results does not match your
expectations, go back and tweak the parameters and test again.

Adding a subscription
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Subscriptions can be added by clicking the 'New' button on any bibliographic
record and choosing 'New subscription'

|newsubfromrecord|

Or click the 'New subscription' button in the serials module

|serialsmodule|

If you are entering a new subscription from the Serials module you will
be presented with a blank form (if creating new from a bibliographic
record the form will include the record number info).

|addsub|

-  Vendor: can be found by either searching vendors entered via the
   :ref:`Acquisitions module <acquisitions-label>` or manually entering 
   the vendor ID number

   -  Vendor information is not required

   -  In order to claim missing and late issues you need to enter vendor
      information

      |vendorwarning|

-  Record: the biblionumber of the MARC record you'd like to link this
   subscription to

   -  If you created a new subscription from a bibliographic record, the
      biblionumber and the title will already be filled in

   -  You can search for an existing record by clicking on the 'Search for
      record' link below the boxes

   -  If there is no existing bibliographic record for this subscription, you
      can create one by clicking on the 'Create record' link below the boxes

   -  You can also manually enter the biblionumber for a record in the first
      box

-  Next you can choose whether a new item is created when receiving an
   issue

   .. Note::

     If you add barcodes to issues or if your circulate them, choose to create
     an item upon reception

-  When there is an irregular issue: choose how to handle irregularities in
   your subscription, by either skipping the issue number or keeping the issue
   number

   .. Note::

     If the numbers are always sequential, choose 'Keep issue number'

-  Manual history: if checked, you will be able to enter serials
   outside the prediction pattern once the subscription is saved. For example,
   'The library has issues from June 1974 to December 1996'. To do so, go to
   the 'Planning' tab on the subscription detail page once the subscription is
   saved and click 'Edit history'.

   |subscriptionplanning|

-  Call number: your item's call number or call number prefix, this will be
   copied to items if they are created upon receiving.

-  Library: the branch that owns this subscription.

   -  If more than one library subscribes to this serial you will need
      to create a subscription for each library

   -  This can be done easily by using the 'Edit as new (duplicate)'
      option found on the subscription information page and changing
      only the 'Library' field

      |newasduplicate|

-  Public note: any notes you would like to appear in the OPAC for the patrons

-  Nonpublic note: should be used for notes that are only visible to staff
   members via the staff interface

-  Patron notification: you can pick a notice to send to patrons who subscribe
   to updates on this serial via the OPAC.

   -  For this option to appear you need to make sure that you have a
      'Serials (new issue)'-type notice set up in the
      :ref:`'Notices and slips' tool <notices-and-slips-label>`

-  Location: the shelving location, this will be copied to items if they are
   created upon receiving.

-  Item type: if creating items upon reception, choose the item type of the
   items created.

-  Item type for older issues: if creating items upon reception, choose the
   item type that will be assigned to previous issues when receiving new issues.
   This will only appear only if the :ref:`makePreviousSerialAvailable <makePreviousSerialAvailable-label>` is
   enabled.

-  Grace period: the number of days before an issue is automatically moved
   from 'Expected' status to 'Late'. This mechanism requires that the
   :ref:`SerialsUpdate.pl cron job <cron-serials-update-label>` is set up to
   run regularly.

-  Number of issues to display to staff: this allows you to control how many
   issues appear by default in the staff interface catalog, in the
   'Subscriptions' tab of the bibliographic record.

   -  If this is left empty, the value of the :ref:`StaffSerialIssueDisplayCount <StaffSerialIssueDisplayCount-label>`
      system preference will be used.

   .. Note::

     This does not affect the number of items shown in the 'Holdings' tab if
     you create items for issues. It only affects the number of issues
     displayed in the 'Subscriptions' tab.

-  Number of issues to display to the public: this allows you to control how many
   issues appear by default in the OPAC, in the 'Subscriptions' tab in
   bibliographic records

   -  If this is left empty, the value of the :ref:`OPACSerialIssueDisplayCount <OPACSerialIssueDisplayCount-label>`
      system preference will be used.

   .. Note::

     This does not affect the number of items shown in the 'Holdings' tab if
     you create items for issues. It only affects the number of issues
     displayed in the 'Subscriptions' tab.

Once that data is filled in you can click 'Next' to enter the prediction
pattern information.

|addsub2|

-  First issue publication date: enter the date of the issue you have in your

   If the frequency you are looking for is not there, you can
   :ref:`add a custom frequency<adding-serial-frequency-label>`.

   have ended (if you're entering in a backlog of serials).

      -  For example: If the first issue to receive is "vol. 4, no. 1,
         iss. 796", you need to set up "inner counter = 0" But if it's
         "vol. 4, no. 2, iss. 797", the inner counter should be "1".

   -  After filling in this data click the 'Test prediction pattern'
      button to see what issues the system will generate, if there are
      irregularities you can choose which issues don't exist from the
      list presented.
