Libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When setting up your Koha system you will want to add information for
every library that will be sharing your system. This data is used in
several areas of Koha.

-  *Get there:* More > Administration > Basic parameters > Libraries

When visiting this page you are presented with a list of the libraries that
have already been added to the system.

|librarylist|

.. Note::

   You can customize the columns of this table in the
   :ref:`'Table settings'<column-settings-label>` section of the
   Administration module (table id: libraries).

Clicking on the library's name will bring you to a detailed view of the
library's information.

.. _adding-a-library-label:

Adding a library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To add a new library:

-  Click 'New library'

-  The top of the form asks for some basics about the library

   |newlibrary|

   -  Library code (required): the code should not contain any spaces or hyphens and be
      10 or fewer characters. This code will be used as a unique identifier in
      the database.

   -  Name (required): the name will be displayed on the OPAC and staff interface wherever
      the library name displays, and should be a name that makes sense to
      your patrons and staff.

-  Next you can enter basic contact info about the branch

   |librarycontact|

   -  Address, city, state, zip/postal code, country, phone, fax: the address
      and contact fields can be used to make
      :ref:`notices <notices-and-slips-label>` custom for each library, they
      will also be displayed in the
      :ref:`'Libraries' page of the OPAC <opaclibrariespage-label>`, if this
      library is set as 'Public'

   -  Email: the email address field is not required, but it should be filled
      for every library in your system

      .. Note::

         Be sure to enter a library email address to make sure that notices are
         sent to and from the right address

      .. Note::

         If no email address is entered here, the address in the
         :ref:`ReturnpathDefault <ReturnpathDefault-label>` system
         preference will be used to receive bounced messages from this library.

   -  SMTP server: if this library uses a different
      :ref:`SMTP server <smtp-servers-label>` from the default, specify it here.

   -  URL: if this field is populated, the library name will be linked
      in the holdings table on the OPAC

      |librarylink|

   -  OPAC info: this leads to the
      :ref:`HTML customization <html-customizations-label>` tool, so that you
      can add additional information about the library. This information will
      appear in the :ref:`'Libraries' page in the OPAC <opaclibrariespage-label>`,
      as well as in the holdings table in the OPAC.

      |libraryinfo|

   -  MARC organization code: if this library has a specific
      `MARC organization code <http://www.loc.gov/marc/organizations/orgshome.html>`_,
      you can enter it here.

      .. Note::

         If left blank, the code entered in the
         :ref:`MARCOrgCode <MARCOrgCode-label>` system preference will be used
         for this library.

   -  Notes: if you have any notes you can put them here. These will not show in
      the OPAC.

   -  Pickup location: choose whether this library will display as an available

.. _circulation-desks-label:

Circulation desks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Koha allows you to define several circulation desks within a single library.
For example, if you have an adult circulation desk and a children's circulation 
desk, or if you have a different desk for each floor or each department.

Make sure to enable the :ref:`UseCirculationDesks <UseCirculationDesks-label>` system preference to use this 
functionality.

-  *Get there:* More > Administration > Basic parameters > Desks

.. _adding-circulation-desks:

.. _item-types-label:

Item types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Koha allows you to organize your collection by item types and collection
codes.

-  *Get there:* More > Administration > Basic parameters > Item types

Item types typically refer to the material type (Book, CD, DVD, etc),
but can be used in any way that works for your library.

|image134|

     **Note**

     -  You can customize the columns of this table in the 
        :ref:`'Table settings'<column-settings-label>` section of the 
        Administration module (table id: table_item_type).

.. _adding-item-types-label:

Adding item types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To add a new item type, simply click the 'New item type' button at the
top of the Item types page.

|image135|

-  In the 'Item type' field, enter a short code for your item type (maximum
   of 10 characters)

-  The the 'Parent item type' field, you can choose an item type that will act 
   as a parent category for this item type. You can then define 
   :ref:`circulation rules <circulation-and-fines-rules-label>` based on those 
   parent item types.

   -  For example, you could have DVD and Blu-ray item types, and the DVD would 
      be the parent of the Blu-ray item type.

      |image1510|

      You can then create a :ref:`circulation rule <circulation-and-fines-rules-label>` 
      for either Blu-ray only or DVD and Blu-ray (DVD (All))

      |image1511|

-  The description is the plain text definition of the item type (for
   those with multiple languages installed you can translate the item
   type description in to all of those languages using the 'Translate in
   to other languages' link)

-  Item types can be grouped together for searching at the same time.
   For example you can put DVDs and Blu-rays in to a group called Movie
   and then they can be searched together. These groups are defined in
   the ITEMTYPECAT :ref:`authorized value category <existing-values-label>`.

-  You can choose to have an image associated with your item type

   -  You can choose from a series of image collections

   -  You can link to a remote image

   -  Or you can just have no image associated with the item type

      .. Warning::

         If this option is not enabled, you can change the setting of the
         :ref:`noItemTypeImages <noItemTypeImages-label>` or :ref:`OPACNoItemTypeImages <OPACNoItemTypeImages-label>`.

      .. Note::

         To have your item type images appear in the OPAC you need to
         set :ref:`OPACnoItemTypeImages <OPACnoItemTypeImages-label>` to 'Show'.

-  For items that you are suppressing from the OPAC you can hide their
   item type from being searched in the OPAC

      **Note**
      This will not prevent those items to appear in search results, it
      will simply remove the item type from the advanced search form.

      If you want to completely hide items from a certain item type, let's
      say that you have a professional library with books reserved for staff
      and you don't want those to appear in the OPAC, use the
      :ref:`OpacHiddenItems <OpacHiddenItems-label>` system preference.

-  For items that do not circulate, check the 'Not for loan' options

   -  Items marked 'Not for loan' will appear in the catalog, but cannot
      be checked out to patrons

-  For items that are not physical, but for which you still have circulation rules, 
   such as museum passes or ebooks, you can set up automatic checkins. 

   -  Check the 'Automatic checkin' box

   -  Schedule the :ref:`cronjob misc/cronjobs/automatic_checkin.pl <cron-automatic-checkin-label>`.

-  For items that you charge a rental fee for, there are several ways that rental
   fees can be charged to a patron by item type. A flat rental charge
   (process fee) or a daily/hourly rental charge.

    -  For items that a library would charge a flat rental charge (process fee)
       for, enter the total fee you charge in the ‘Rental charge’ field.
       This will charge the patron on checkout (and renewal).

    -  For items that a rental charge will be charged by the number of days
       the item is checked out for, enter the daily fee in the 'Daily rental
       charge'. This will be charged to the patron upon checkout -
       the cost per day and how many days this item can be checked out to the
       patron. This daily rental charge will also be applied if/when a renewal
       occurs. 

       -  Check the 'Daily rentals use calendar', to exclude holidays from 
          the rental fee calculation.

    -  For items that are loaned out hourly, enter the cost per hour in 'Hourly 
       rental charge'. Again, the total (hourly cost * number of hours loaned) 
       will be charged to the patron upon checkout and renewal.

       -  Check the 'Hourly rentals use calendar', to exclude holidays from 
          the rental fee calculation.

    - Each amount will charge the patron on checkout.

      **Important**

      Do not enter symbols in this field, only numbers and decimal
      points (ex. $5.00 should be entered as 5 or 5.00)

-  You can add a default replacement cost for this type of item. This is the
   amount that will be charged to the patron when lost if the item doesn't have 
   a replacement cost. If the item has a replacement cost, that is the amount 
   that will be charged to the patron.

    **Important**

    Do not enter symbols in this field, only numbers and decimal
    points (ex. $5.00 should be entered as 5 or 5.00)

- You can also add a processing fee that will be added to the replacement cost.

  **Important**

  Do not enter symbols in this field, only numbers and decimal
  points (ex. $5.00 should be entered as 5 or 5.00)

-  If you would like a message or alert to appear when items of this
   type are checked in you can enter that in the 'Checkin message' box

   |image136|

   -  The check-in message type can be a 'message' or an 'alert'. The only
      difference between these two is the styling. By default a message
      is blue

      |image137|

      and an alert is yellow.

      |image138|

-  Some SIP devices need you to use a SIP-specific media type instead of
   Koha's item type (usually lockers and sorters need this media type).
   If you use a device like this you'll want to enter the SIP media
   type.

-  If this item type is only to be used in certain libraries, you can select 
   them here. Select 'All libraries' if this item type is used across the library 
   system.

   **Note** 

   If this is left blank, 'All libraries' is assumed.

   **Note**

   To select more than one library, hold the 'Ctrl' key while selecting the 
   libraries.

.. add description of 'Summary', unless bug 17598 passes...

-  When finished, click 'Save changes'

   **Note**

   All fields, with the exception of the 'Item type' will be
   editable from the item types list

-  Your new item type will now appear on the list

   |image139|

.. _editing-item-types-label:

Editing item types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each item type has an Edit button beside it. To edit an item simply
click the 'Edit' button.

    **Important**

    You will not be able to edit the code you assigned as the 'Item
    type' but you will be able to edit the description for the item.

.. _deleting-item-types-label:

Deleting item types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each item has a Delete button beside it. To delete an item type, simply click
the 'Delete' button.

    **Important**

    You will not be able to delete item types that are being used by
    items within your system.

|image140|

.. _authorized-values-label:

Authorized values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Authorized values can be used in several areas of Koha. They are lists of 
controlled terms, phrases or codes.

For example, one reason you would add an authorized value category would be to 
control the values that can be entered into MARC fields by catalogers.

-  *Get there:* More > Administration > Basic parameters > Authorized values

      regardless of the setting in :ref:`RequireStrongPassword <RequireStrongPassword-label>`.

   -  No: patrons of this category will *not* be required to have a strong 
      password regardless of the setting in :ref:`RequireStrongPassword <RequireStrongPassword-label>`.

-  Block expired patrons: decide if this patrons from this category are blocked 
   from performing actions in the OPAC if their card is expired. By default it 
   will follow the rule set in the :ref:`BlockExpiredPatronOpacActions <BlockExpiredPatronOpacActions-label>` 
   preference.

   -  Follow the system preference :ref:`BlockExpiredPatronOpacActions <BlockExpiredPatronOpacActions-label>`.

   -  Block: patrons of this category whose membership has expired will be 
      blocked from renewing and placing holds in the OPAC, regardless of the 
      setting in :ref:`BlockExpiredPatronOpacActions <BlockExpiredPatronOpacActions-label>`.

   -  Don't block: patrons of this category whose membership has expired will 
      *not* be blocked from renewing and placing holds in the OPAC, regardless 
      of the setting in :ref:`BlockExpiredPatronOpacActions <BlockExpiredPatronOpacActions-label>`.

-  Check for previous checkouts: if the
   :ref:`CheckPrevCheckout <checkprevcheckout-label>` system preference is set
   to either 'Unless overridden by patron category' options, you will be able
   to set the value for this particular patron category here.

   -  Yes and try to override system preferences: Koha will check if the patron
      already checked out this item, unless the patron's personal settings
      prevent it.

   -  No and try to override system preferences: Koha will not check in the
      patron already checked out this item, unless the patron's personal
      settings permit it.

   -  Inherit from system preferences: the setting of the
      :ref:`CheckPrevCheckout <checkprevcheckout-label>` system preference
      will be followed.

-  Default privacy: choose the default privacy settings for patrons of this
   category. 

   -  Default: checkout history will be kept indefinitely, until either the 
      :ref:`batch\_anonymize.pl script <cron-anonymize-patron-data-label>` is 
      run or there is a manual 
      :ref:`batch anonymization <patrons-anonymize-bulk-delete-label>` which 
      is performed.

   -  Never: checkout history is anonymized upon return. Statistics are kept, 
      but the link between the checkout, the item and the patron is removed.

   -  Forever: checkout history is never anonymized for patrons of this 
      category, regardless of the cron job or manual anonymization.

   -  This setting can be edited by the patron via the OPAC if you allow it 
      with the :ref:`OPACPrivacy <OPACPrivacy-label>` system preference.

-  Exclude from local holds priority: choose whether holds for patrons of this 
   category are given a priority.

   -  Yes: holds for patrons of this category are not given special priority,
      regardless of the setting in 
      :ref:`LocalHoldsPriority <localholdspriority-preferences-label>`.

   -  No: holds for patrons of this category are subjected to the setting in 
      :ref:`LocalHoldsPriority <localholdspriority-preferences-label>`.

-  Default messaging preferences for this patron category: assign
   :ref:`advanced messaging preferences <advance-notices-and-hold-notices-label>`
   by default to the patron category

   -  These default preferences can be
      :ref:`changed on an individual basis <advance-notices-and-hold-notices-label>`
      for each patron. This setting is just a default to make it easier to set up
      messages when creating new patrons. 

   .. Note::

      This requires that you have
      :ref:`EnhancedMessagingPreferences <EnhancedMessagingPreferences-label>`
      system preference set to 'Allow'.

   .. Warning::

      These defaults will only be applied to new patrons that are added to the
      system. They will not edit the preferences of the existing patrons.

      If you need to apply the default preferences to existing patrons, you can
      force those changes by running the
      :ref:`borrowers-force-messaging-defaults script <cron-borrowers-messaging-preferences-label>`
      found in the misc/maintenance folder. Ask your system administrator for
      assistance with this script.

.. _circulation-and-fines-rules-label:

Circulation and fines rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These rules define how your items are circulated, how and when fines are
calculated and how holds are handled.

-  *Get there:* More > Administration > Patrons and circulation >
   Circulation and fines rules

The rules are applied from most specific to less specific, using the
first found in this order:

-  same library, same patron category, same item type

-  same library, same patron category, all item types

-  same library, all patron categories, same item type

-  same library, all patron categories, all item types

-  default (all libraries), same patron category, same item type

-  default (all libraries), same patron category, all item types

-  default (all libraries), all patron categories, same item type

-  default (all libraries), all patron categories, all item types

The :ref:`CircControl <CircControl-label>` and :ref:`HomeOrHoldingBranch <HomeOrHoldingBranch-label>` also come in to play when
figuring out which circulation rule to follow.

-  If :ref:`CircControl <CircControl-label>` is set to "the library you are logged in at" circulation
   rules will be selected based on the library you are logged in at

-  If :ref:`CircControl <CircControl-label>` is set to "the library the patron is from" circulation rules
   will be selected based on the patron's library

-  If :ref:`CircControl <CircControl-label>` is set to "the library the item is from" circulation rules
   will be selected based on the item's library where
   :ref:`HomeOrHoldingBranch <HomeOrHoldingBranch-label>` chooses if the item's home library  or its holding
   library is used.

-  If :ref:`IndependentBranches <IndependentBranches-label>` is set to 'Prevent'
   then the value of :ref:`HomeOrHoldingBranch <HomeOrHoldingBranch-label>` is used in figuring out if the
   item can be checked out. If the item's home library does not match
   the logged in library, the item cannot be checked out unless you are
   a :ref:`superlibrarian <patron-permissions-defined-label>`.

    **Important**

    At the very least you will need to set a default circulation rule.
    This rule should be set for all item types, all libraries and all
    patron categories. That will catch all instances that do not match a
    specific rule. When checking out if you do not have a rule for all
    libraries, all item types and all patron categories then you may see
    patrons getting blocked from placing holds.

.. _defining-circulation-rules-label:

Defining circulation rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using the issuing rules matrix you can define rules that depend on
patron category/item type combos. 

.. Note:: 
  
   The matrix being very wide, you can export the existing rules in Microsoft 
   Excel or CSV format, to look at them, using the 'Export' button at the top 
   of the table.

To set your rules, choose a library from the
pull down (or 'Standard rules for all libraries' if you want to apply these rules 
to all branches):

|image156|

From the matrix you can choose any combination of patron categories and
item types to apply the rules to

|image157|

-  First choose which patron category you'd like the rule to be applied
   to. If you leave this to 'All' it will apply to all patron categories

-  Choose the item type you would like this rule to apply to. If you
   leave this to 'All' it will apply to all item types for this patron category

   -  If an item type has a parent item type, the rule will be displayed as 
      Parent -> Child. The number of current checkouts will be limited to either 
      the maximum for the parent (including sibling types) or the specific type's
      rule, whichever is less.

      |image1512|

      In the example above, there is a rule for the DVD item type with a 
      maximum of 5 checkouts and a rule for Blu-ray, a child of DVD, with a 
      maximum of 2 checkouts. A patron at this library will be able to check out 
      a maximum of 2 Blu-rays in a total of 5 items of either DVD or Blu-ray 
      types.

      To summarize, a patron at this library would be able to take either :
      -  0 Blu-ray and a maximum of 5 DVDs
      -  1 Blu-ray and a maximum of 4 DVDs
      -  2 Blu-ray and a maximum of 3 DVDs

-  Add notes about your circulation rule into the notes field. This can
   be helpful to remember why and when something was last changed.

-  Limit the number of items of this type a patron of this category can have 
   checked out at the same time by entering a number in the 'Current checkouts 
   allowed' field.

-  If you're allowing :ref:`on-site checkouts <onsitecheckouts-label>` then you
   may also want to set a limit on the number of items of this type patrons of 
   this category can have on-site.

   -  **Note**

          This setting also depends on the
          :ref:`ConsiderOnSiteCheckoutsAsNormalCheckouts <ConsiderOnSiteCheckoutsAsNormalCheckouts-label>`
          preference

-  Define the period of time an item of this type can be checked out to a 
   patron of this category by entering the number of units (days or hours) in 
   the 'Loan period' box.

-  Define if the loan period should include closed days or not in the 'Days 
   mode' column. The option chosen here will override the :ref:`useDaysMode <useDaysMode-label>` 
   system preference for this particular rule.

   -  The 'Default' option will take the option defined in the 
      :ref:`useDaysMode <useDaysMode-label>` system preference

   -  Choose the 'Calendar' option if you want to use the calendar to skip the 
      days when the library is closed

   -  Choose the 'Datedue' option if you want to push the due date to the next 
      open day

   -  Choose the 'Days' option if you want to ignore the calendar and calculate 
      the due date directly

   -  Choose the 'Dayweek' option if you want to use the calendar to push the 
      due date to the next open matching weekday for weekly loan periods, or 
      the next open day otherwise

-  Choose which unit of time, days or hours, that the loan period and
   fines will be calculated in in the 'Unit' column

-  You can also define a hard due date for a specific patron category
   and item type. The hard due date offers three options:

   -  Exactly on: The due date of any item checked out with this rule
      will be set to the hard due date.

   -  Before: Koha will calculate the normal loan period. If the calculated
      due date would be after or on the hard due date, the hard due date
      will be used instead.

   -  After: Koha will calculate the normal loan period. If the calculated
      due date would be before the hard due date, the hard due date will
      be used instead.

-  'Fine amount' should have the amount you would like to charge for
   overdue items.

   **Important**

   Enter only numbers and decimal points (no currency symbols).

-  Enter the 'Fine charging interval' in the unit you set (ex. charge
   fines every 1 day, or every 2 hours). The :ref:`finesCalendar <finesCalendar-label>` system
   preference controls whether the days the library is closed will be taken
   into account or not.

-  'When to charge' is most handy in libraries that have a fine charging
   interval of more than 1 day.

   -  End of interval: Given a grace period of 2 days and a fine interval of 7 
      days, the first fine will appear 7 days after the due date, it will 
      always take one fine interval (7 days), before the first fine is charged.

   -  Start of interval: Given a grace period of 2 days and a fine interval of 
      7 days, the first fine will appear 2 days after the due date and the
      second fine 7 days after the due date.

-  The 'Fine grace period' is the period of time an item can be overdue
   before you start charging fines. The :ref:`FinesIncludeGracePeriod <FinesIncludeGracePeriod-label>`
   system preference controls if the grace period will be included when
   calculating the fine or not.

   **Important**

   This can only be set for the 'Day' unit, not in 'Hours'

-  The 'Overdue fines cap' is the maximum fine per item for this patron
   and item type combination.

   **Important**

   If this field is left blank then Koha will not put a limit on the fines 
   this item will accrue. A maximum fine amount for all overdues can be
   set using the :ref:`MaxFine <MaxFine-label>` system preference.

-  If you would like to prevent overcharging patrons for a lost items,
   you can check the box under 'Cap fine at replacement price.' This
   will prevent the patron's fines from going above the replacement
   price on the item.

   **Note**

   If the 'Overdue fines cap' is also set, the fine will be the
   lesser of the two, if both apply to the given overdue
   checkout.

-  If your library 'fines' patrons by suspending their account you can
   enter the number of days their fine should be suspended in the
   'Suspension in days' field.

   **Important**

   This can only be set for the 'Day' unit, not in 'Hours'

-  You can also define the maximum number of days a patron will be
   suspended in the 'Max suspension duration' setting

-  The 'Suspension charging interval' option is just like the 'Fin charging 
   interval'. For example, you could 'fine' a patron one day suspension for 
   every two days overdue.

-  Next decide if the patron can renew this item type and if so, enter
   how many times they can renew it in the 'Renewals allowed' box.

-  If you allow unseen renewals (see :ref:`UnseenRenewals <UnseenRenewals-label>`), enter how many
   'unseen' renewals patrons can make. This is *not* in addition to the regular 
   renewals, but rather how many 'unseen' renewals can be made *among* the 
   total number of renewals.

-  If you're allowing renewals you can control how long the renewal loan
   period will be (in the units you have chosen) in the 'Renewal period'
   box.

-  If you're allowing renewals you can control how soon before the due
   date patrons can renew their materials with the 'No renewals before'
   box.

   -  Items can be renewed at any time if this value is left blank.
      Otherwise items can only be renewed if the item is due after the
      number in units (days/hours) entered in this box.

   -  To control this value on a more granular level please set the
      :ref:`NoRenewalBeforePrecision <NoRenewalBeforePrecision-label>` preference.

-  You can enable automatic renewals for certain items/patrons if you'd
   like. This will renew automatically following your circulation rules
   unless there is a hold on the item.

   **Important**

   You will need to enable the 
   :ref:`automatic renewal cron job <cron-automatic-renewal-label>` for this to 
   work.

   **Important**

   This feature needs to have the "no renewal before" column
   filled in or it will auto renew every day after the due date.

-  If you are using automatic renewals, you can use the 'No automatic renewals 
   after' to limit the time a patron can have the item. For example: don't 
   allow automatic renewals after a checkout period of 80 days.

-  Similar to the hard due date setting, you can also stop automatic renewals
   after a specific date using the 'No automatic renewal after (hard limit)'
   setting.

-  If patrons of this category can place holds on items of this type, enter the 
   total numbers of items (of this type) that can be put on hold in the 'Holds
   allowed' field.

   -  Leave empty to have unlimited holds.

   -  If you'd rather put a hold limit per patron category, independent of the 
      item type, see the 
      :ref:`default checkout and hold policy by patron category <default-checkouts-and-hold-by-category-label>` 
      section below.

   -  If you want to have a hard hold limit, independent of patron category and 
      item type, for this particular library, see the
      :ref:`Default checkout, hold, and return policy <default-checkouts-and-hold-policy-label>`
      section below.

   -  If you want to have a hard hold limit, independent of patron category, 
      item type, and across all libraries, see the :ref:`maxreserves <maxreserves-label>` system 
      preference.

-  You can also set a daily limit on the number of holds a patron can place.

-  While the two settings before limit the holds that can be placed across
   various records, the next setting is used to limit the number of holds
   that can be placed on one record at the same time.
   For example, for fiction books you might want to allow only one item to be 
   placed on hold at the same time by the same user. But for serials where items
   represent different issues more than one hold at the same time is fine.

   **Note**

   If this is set to a number that is greater than 1, but not Unlimited,
   then staff will have the option of placing multiple holds at once when
   placing a hold on the next available item in the :ref:`staff interface <placing-holds-in-staff-client-label>`

-  Next you can decide how the availability of items influences the ability
   to place a hold. The 'On shelf holds allowed' option has three settings:

   -  Yes: This will allow to place holds on items at all times. It doesn't
      matter if they are available or checked out.

   -  If any unavailable: This will allow to place a hold as soon as one
      or more items of the record are checked out. It doesn't matter if
      there are still one or more items available on the shelf.

   -  If all unavailable: This will allow to place a hold as soon as all
      items on the record are checked out that could fill the hold. This is
      especially useful for libraries that don't offer the service of getting 
      items placed on hold off the shelf for patrons.

-  Under 'OPAC item level hold' you can decide if patrons are allowed to place 
   item specific holds on the item type in question. The options are:

   -  Allow: Will allow patrons the option to choose next available or
      a specific item.

   -  Don't allow: Will only allow patrons to choose next available item.

   -  Force: Will only allow patrons to choose a specific item.

-  If you want to allow patrons of this category to be able to place article 
   requests on items of this type, choose an option in the 'Article requests' 
   column

   -  No: patrons of this category will not be able to place article requests 
      on items of this type

   -  Yes: patrons of this category will be able to place article requests on 
      items of this type, either on specific items (for example in the case of 
      serial issues) or on entire records (for example in the case of 
      monographs)

   -  Record only: patrons of this category will be able to place article 
      requests on records of this type, but not on specific items

   -  Item only: patrons of this category will be able to place article 
      requests on items of this type, but not on entire records

   .. Warning::

      This column will only appear if the
      :ref:`ArticleRequests <ArticleRequests-label>` system preference is
      enabled.

      If you want to use the article request functionality you need to enable it
      using the :ref:`ArticleRequests <ArticleRequests-label>` system preference
      and configure the form using the other related preferences.

-  If you :ref:`charge a rental fee for the item type <adding-item-types-label>`
   and want to give this specific patron category a discount on that fee,
   enter the percentage discount (without the % symbol) in the 'Rental
   discount' field

-  If the :ref:`UseRecalls <UseRecalls-label>` system preference is enabled, you will have several
   options to control recalls.

   -  Recalls allowed (total): enter the number of current recalls a patron of
      this category can have on items or records of this item type.

   -  Recalls per record (count): enter the number of current recalls a patron
      of this category can have on any one record of this item type.

   -  On shelf recalls allowed: choose if patrons can recall items on records
      that have available items

      -  If any unavailable: if a record has more than one item and at least
         one is unavailable, the patron will be able to recall items from this
         record

      -  If all unavailable: all items of a record must be unavailable in order
         for a patron to recall an item from this record

   -  Recall due date interval (day): enter the number of days a patron has to
      return an item that has been recalled

   -  Recall overdue fine amount: enter the fine amount a patron will be
      charged if they don't return the recalled item by the due date

   -  Recall pickup period: enter the number of days a patron has to come pick
      up the item they have recalled, once it has been marked as awaiting pickup.

      .. Note::

         This value supercedes the value in the :ref:`RecallsMaxPickUpDelay <RecallsMaxPickUpDelay-label>`
         system preference.

When finished, click 'Save' to save your changes. To modify a rule,
simply click the 'Edit' button either at the beginning or at the end of the row.
The row of the rule being edited will be highlighted in yellow and the values 
will appear filled in at the bottom of the table. Edit the values at the bottom 
and click save.

|image158|

  **Note**

  If, while editing a rule, you change either the patron category or the item 
  type, it will create a new rule. You can do this to duplicate rules instead of 
  creating new ones if the values are similar.

Alternatively, you can create a rule with the same patron category and item type 
and it will edit the existing one, as there can only be one rule per library-
patron category-item type combination.

If you would like to delete your rule, click the 'Delete' button at the beginning
or at the end of the rule row.

To save time you can clone rules from one library to another by choosing
the clone option above the rules matrix. Please note that this will overwrite
all rules already configured for that library.

|image159|

After choosing to clone you will be presented with a confirmation message.

|image160|

.. _default-checkouts-and-hold-policy-label:

Default checkout, hold, and return policy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can set a default maximum number of checkouts, a default maximum number
of holds and a hold policy that
will be used if none is defined below for a particular item type or
category. This is the fall back rule for defaults.

|image161|

From this menu you can set a default to apply to all item types and
patrons in the library if no other option is set in the forms below.

-  In 'Total current checkouts allowed' enter the total number of items
   patrons can have checked out at one time

-  In 'Total current on-site checkouts allowed' enter the total number
   of items patrons can have checked out on site at a time
   (:ref:`OnSiteCheckouts <OnSiteCheckouts-label>` needs to be set to 'Enable')

-  In 'Maximum total holds allowed (count)' enter the total number
   of pending holds patrons can have at the same time.

-  Control where patrons can place holds from using the 'Hold Policy'
   menu

   -  From Any Library: Patrons from any library may put this item on
      hold. (default if none is defined)

   -  From Local Hold Group: Only patrons from a library in the item home
      library’s local hold group may put this book on hold.

   -  From Home Library: Only patrons from the item's home library may
      put this book on hold.

   -  No Holds Allowed: No patron may put this book on hold.

-  Control where patron can pick up holds using the “Hold Pickup Library
   Match” menu

   -  any library

   -  item's hold group

   -  patron's hold group

   -  item's home library

   -  item's holding library


-  Control where the item returns to once it is checked in

   -  Item returns home

   -  Item returns to issuing branch

   -  Item floats

      -  When an item floats it stays where it was checked in and does
         not ever return 'home'

-  Once your policy is set, you can unset it by clicking the 'Unset'
   link to the right of the rule

.. _default-checkouts-and-hold-by-category-label:

Default checkout and hold policy by patron category
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For this library, you can specify the maximum number of checkouts,
on-site checkouts and holds that a patron of a given category can have,
regardless of the item type.

|image162|

    **Note**

    If the total amount of checkouts, on-site checkout and holds
    for a given patron category is left blank, no limit applies,
    except possibly for a limit you define in the circulation rules above.

For example, if you have a rule in the matrix that says Board patrons
are allowed 10 books and 5 DVDs but you want to make it so that Board
patrons only have a total of 12 things checked out at once. If you enter
12 here and the patron has 10 books out already they will only be
allowed 2 DVDs to equal the 12 total they're allowed.

.. _defaultwaitingholdcancellationpolicy-label:

Default waiting hold cancellation policy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For this library, you can specify if patrons can cancel holds that are already
awaiting pickup.

|defaultwaitingholdcancellationpolicy|

For each patron category and item type combination, choose if these patrons can
cancel holds that are already waiting for pickup.

Just like the circulation rules, the more specific rules will apply before the
more generic rules (i.e. the "all" patron categories / "all" item types rule
will apply only if no other rule exists for this combination).

.. _default-open-article-requests-limit-label:

Default open article requests limit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If :ref:`ArticleRequests <ArticleRequests-label>` is enabled, you can set a maximum number of open
article requests a patron of a category can have at one time.

|defaultopenarticlerequestslimit|

.. Note::

   This will only appear if the :ref:`ArticleRequests <ArticleRequests-label>` system preference is
   enabled.

-  Choose the patron category you want to limit.

-  Enter the number of open article requests a patron of this category can have
   at one given time

-  Click 'Add'

.. _default-article-request-fees-label:

Default article request fees
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If :ref:`ArticleRequests <ArticleRequests-label>` is enabled, you can set the fee a patron from a given
category (or any category) needs to pay in order to request the article.

|defaultarticlerequestfee|

.. Note::

   This will only appear if the :ref:`ArticleRequests <ArticleRequests-label>` system preference is
   enabled.

-  Choose the patron category for which you want to add a fee, or choose 'All'
   to set an overall fee for all patrons

   .. Note::

      The fee specific to a patron category will supercede the fee for all
      categories.

      For example, if you set a fee for all categories to 2$ and a fee for
      Faculty to 3$, Faculty members will be charged 3$ and any other patron
      will be charged 2$.

-  Enter the fee amount (use a period as the decimal and don't enter any symbols,
   e.g. enter 5.00 for 5$)

-  Click 'Add'

The fee is charged to the patron :ref:`when the request is placed<placing-article-requests-label>`.

When placing the request, either through the staff interface or the OPAC, a
message appears to inform the staff member or the patron that the patron will
be charged for every request and the amount of the fee.

.. _item-fee-refund-on-return-label:

Default lost item fee refund on return policy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here, you can specify the default policy for lost item fees on return.

|defaultlostitemfeerefund|

-  Refund lost item replacement fee: choose whether or not the item's
   replacement cost is refunded when the lost item is returned.

   -  Refund lost item charge: the replacement cost is refunded. This might
      create a credit to be paid out to the patron if they had already paid the
      fee.

   -  Refund lost item charge (only if unpaid): the replacement cost is refunded
      only if it hasn't yet been paid.

   -  Refund lost item charge and charge new overdue fine: the replacement cost
      is refunded and overdue fines are calculated as of today.

   -  Refund lost item charge and restore overdue fine: the replacement cost is
      refunded and fines are restored as of the day the item was declared lost.

   -  Leave lost item charge: the replacement cost stays in the patron's account.

-  Refund lost item processing fee: choose whether or not the item's processing
   fee is refunded when the lost item is returned.

   -  Refund lost item processing charge: the processing fee is refunded. This
      might create a credit to be paid out to the patron if they had already
      paid the fee.

   -  Refund lost item processing charge (only if unpaid): the processing fee
      is refunded only if it hasn't yet been paid.

   -  Leave lost item processing charge: the processing fee stays in the patron's
      account.

This policy will apply to this library. This rule is to be used with the
:ref:`RefundLostOnReturnControl <RefundLostOnReturnControl-label>` system preference.

You can limit the number of days during which a lost item is refundable using 
the :ref:`NoRefundOnLostReturnedItemsAge <NoRefundOnLostReturnedItemsAge-label>` system preference.

.. _item-hold-policies-label:

Default holds policy by item type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For this library, you can edit hold and return policies for a given item
type, regardless of the patron's category.

|holdsperitem|

The various hold policies have the following effects:

-  From any library: Patrons from any library may put this item on hold.
   (default if none is defined)

-  From local hold group: Only patrons from libraries in the same item's
   home library hold groups may put this book on hold.
   
-  From home library: Only patrons from the item's home library may put
   this book on hold.

-  No holds allowed: No patron may put this book on hold.

    **Important**

    Note that if the system preference
    :ref:`AllowHoldPolicyOverride <AllowHoldPolicyOverride-label>` set to
    'allow', these policies can be overridden by your circulation staff.

    **Important**

    These policies are applied based on the ReservesControlBranch
    system preference.

Control where patron can pick up holds using the “Hold Pickup Library Match”
menu

-  any library

-  item's hold group

-  patron' hold group

-  item's home library

-  item's holding library

The various return policies have the following effects:

-  Item returns home: The item will prompt the librarian to transfer the
   item to its home library

   -  **Important**

          If the :ref:`AutomaticItemReturn <AutomaticItemReturn-label>`
          preference is set to automatically transfer the items home,
          then a prompt will not appear

-  Item returns to issuing branch: The item will prompt the librarian to
   transfer the item back to the library where it was checked out

   -  **Important**

          If the :ref:`AutomaticItemReturn <AutomaticItemReturn-label>`
          preference is set to automatically transfer the items home,
          then a prompt will not appear

-  Item floats: The item will not be transferred from the branch it was
   checked in at, instead it will remain there until transferred
   manually or checked in at another branch

For example you might allow holds at your libraries but not what New
items or DVDs to be placed on hold by other branches so you can set the
'Hold policy' to 'From home library' so that those items can only be
placed on hold if the items' owning library and the patron's home
library are the same. You can also block holds completely on specific
item types from this form. This is also how you can set up floating item
types and types that remain with their home library.

.. Note::

   The library whose return policy is used is determined by the
   :ref:`CircControlReturnsBranch <circcontrolreturnsbranch-label>` system
   preference.

.. _patron-attribute-types-label:

Patron attribute types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  *Get there:* More > Administration > Patrons and circulation > Patron
   attribute types

Patron attributes can be used to define custom fields to associate with
your patron records. In order to enable the use of custom fields you
need to set the :ref:`ExtendedPatronAttributes <ExtendedPatronAttributes-label>`
system preference.

A common use for this field would be for a student ID number or a
Driver's license number.

|attributes|

.. _adding-patron-attributes-label:

Adding patron attribute types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To add a new patron attribute type, click the 'New patron attribute
type' button at the top of the page

|addattribute|

-  Patron attribute type code: enter a short code to identify this field

   .. Warning::

      This field is limited to 10 characters (numbers and letters only)

   .. Warning::

      This setting cannot be changed after an attribute is defined

-  Description: enter a longer (plain text) explanation of what this field will
   contain

-  Repeatable: check this box if a patron record can have multiple values of
   this attribute.

   .. Warning::

      This setting cannot be changed after an attribute is defined

-  Unique identifier: check this box if a value is given to a patron record, the
   same value cannot be given to a different record.

   -  Unique attributes can be used as match points on the :ref:`patron
      import tool <patron-import-label>`

   .. Warning::

      This setting cannot be changed after an attribute is defined

-  Display in OPAC: check this box to display this attribute on a patron's
   details page in the OPAC.

-  Editable in OPAC: check this box to enable patrons to edit this information
   in the OPAC.

-  Searchable: check this box to make this attribute searchable in the staff
   interface's patron search.

-  Mandatory: check this box if the attribute must be filled for every patron

-  Display in patron's brief information: check this box to make this attribute
   visible in the patron's short detail display on the left of the checkout
   screen and other patron pages

   |showattribute|

-  Authorized value category: if one is selected, the patron record
   input page will only allow values to be chosen from the authorized
   value list.

   -  You will first need to
      :ref:`add an authorized value list<add-new-authorized-value-category-label>`
      for it to appear in this menu

   .. Warning::

      An authorized value list is not enforced during
      :ref:`batch patron import<patron-import-label>`.

-  Library limitations: if you would like this attribute to only be used by
   specific branches you can choose those branches from this list. Choose 'All
   branches' to show it for all libraries.

   .. Warning::

      Patrons with attributes already set for them will not be altered. The
      branch limitation only limits the field based on the library at which the
      current staff is logged in.

      If an attribute is set for a patron, it will be displayed in their file
      to all staff. However, only staff from the selected branches will be able
      to edit it.

-  Category: if you'd like to only show this attribute on patrons of one type
   choose that patron category here

-  Class: if you have a lot of attributes it might be handy to group them so
   that you can easily find them for editing. If you create an
   :ref:`authorized value <authorized-values-label>` for PA\_CLASS it will show
   in the 'Class' drop-down menu and you can then change your attributes page
   to have sections of attributes

   |pa_class|

Click 'Save' to save your new attribute.

Once added, your attribute will appear on the list of attributes and also
on the :ref:`patron record add/edit form<add-a-new-patron-label>`

|addattributes|

.. _editing/deleting-patron-attributes-label:

Editing/deleting patron attribute types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each patron attribute has an edit and a delete button beside it on the
list of attributes.

|attributes|

Some fields in the attribute will not be editable once created:

-  Patron attribute type code

-  Repeatable

-  Unique identifier

You will be unable to delete an attribute if it's in use.

|deletepatronattr|

.. _library-transfer-limits-label:

Library transfer limits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Limit the ability to transfer items between libraries based on the
library sending, the library receiving, and the collection code
involved.

-  *Get there:* More > Administration > Patrons and circulation > Library
   transfer limits

These rules only go into effect if the preference
:ref:`UseBranchTransferLimits <usebranchtransferlimits-and-branchtransferlimitstype-label>` is set to 'enforce'.

Before you begin you will want to choose which library you are setting
these limits for.

|image171|

Transfer limits are set based on the collections codes you have applied
via the :ref:`Authorized values <authorized-values-label>` administration area.

|image172|

Collection codes will appear as tabs above the checkboxes:

|image173|

Check the boxes for the libraries you allow your items to be transferred to for the
collection code you have selected at the top (in the example below - FIC)

|image174|

In the above example, Centerville library will allow patrons from all libraries 
except Liberty and Franklin to request items from their branch.

.. _transport-cost-matrix-label:

Transport cost matrix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The transport cost matrix lets a library system define relative costs to
transport books to one another. In order for the system to use this
matrix you must first set the
:ref:`UseTransportCostMatrix <UseTransportCostMatrix-label>` preference to
'Use'.

    **Important**

    The transport cost matrix takes precedence in controlling where
    holds are filled from, if the matrix is not used then Koha checks
    the :ref:`StaticHoldsQueueWeight <holds-queue-system-preferences-label>`.

Costs are decimal values between some arbitrary maximum value (e.g. 1 or
100) and 0 which is the minimum (no) cost. For example, you could just
use the distance between each library in miles as your 'cost', if that
would accurately reflect the cost of transferring them. Perhaps post
offices would be a better measure. Libraries sharing a post office would
have a cost of 1, adjacent post offices would have a cost of 2, etc.

To enter transport costs simply click in the cell you would like to
alter, uncheck the 'Disable' box and enter your 'cost'

|image175|

After entering in your cost, hit 'Enter' on your keyboard or click the
'Save' button at the bottom of the matrix to save your changes.

    **Note**

    A NULL value will make no difference where the From and To libraries
    are the same library. However, as a best practice, you should put a
    0 in there. For all other To/From combinations, a NULL value will
    cause that relationship to act as if it has been disabled. So, in
    summary, don't leave any of the values empty. It's best to always
    put a number in there ( even if you choose to disable that given
    To/From option ).

.. _item-circulation-alerts-label:

Item circulation alerts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Libraries can decide if they want to have patrons automatically notified
of circulation events (check ins and check outs).

-  *Get there:* More > Administration > Patrons and circulation > Item
   circulation alerts

These preferences are set based on patron types and item types.

    **Important**

    These preference can be overridden by changes in the individual
    patron's messaging preferences.

To set up circulation alerts:

-  Choose your library from the pull down at the top of the screen

   |image176|

   -  To set preferences for all libraries, keep the menu set to
      'Default'

-  By default all item types and all patrons are notified of check ins
   and check outs. To change this, click on the item/patron type combo
   that you would like to stop notices for.

   |image177|

   -  In the above example, Juveniles and Kids will not receive check
      out notices.

.. _cities-and-towns-label:

Cities and towns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To standardize patron input you can define cities or towns within your
region so that when new patrons are added librarians simply have to
select the town from a list instead of having to type the town and zip
(or postal) code information.

-  *Get there:* More > Administration > Patrons and circulation > Cities
   and towns

.. _adding-a-city-label:

Adding a city
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To add a new city, click the 'New city' button at the top of the page
and enter the city name, state, zip/postal code and country.

|image178|

One you click Submit, your city will be saved and will be listed on the
Cities and towns page

|image179|

Cities can be edited or deleted at any time.

.. _viewing-cities-on-patron-add-form-label:

Viewing cities on patron add form
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have defined local cities using the 'New city' form, then when
adding or editing a patron record you will see those cities in a pull
down menu to make city selection easy.

|image180|

This will allow for easy entry of local cities into the patron record
without risking the potential for typos or mistaken zip/postal codes.

.. _curbside-pickup-configuration-label:

      interaction will take

   -  Maximum patrons per interval: enter the number of patrons who can pickup
      in the same interval

   -  Patron-scheduled pickup: check this box if you want to allow patrons to
      set up their own curbside pickup appointment through the OPAC

   -  Enable for waiting holds only: check this box if curbside pickup should be
      limited to patrons who have holds awaiting pickup

-  Create curbside pickup slots

   -  For each slot, enter the day of the week, the starting and ending hours
      of the time slot in which patrons can come

      -  these can be your opening hours, if you allow curbside pickup
         throughout the day, or specific time slots in which you allow patrons
         to come by

      -  For the hours, the format must be XX:XX (numbers with a colon) and it
         must be in 24-hour format (e.g. 1 PM is 13:00)

   -  Click 'Add'

-  Click 'Save configuration'

Do this for every library that offers curbside pickup.

.. _system-debit-types-label:

System debit types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Several debit types come installed with Koha. Most of them are 
automatic fees that are added according to the policies you set up 
elsewhere in Koha.

-  ACCOUNT (Account creation fee): this is charged to the patron's 
   account upon registration. The fee can be changed in the 
   :ref:`patron category settings <adding-a-patron-category-label>` 
   under 'Enrollment fee'.

-  ACCOUNT\_RENEW (Account renewal fee): this is charged to the 
   patron's account when their account is renewed. Like the ACCOUNT 
   debit type above, this can be changed in the 
   :ref:`patron category settings <adding-a-patron-category-label>` 
   under 'Enrollment fee'.

-  LOST (Lost item): this is charged to the patron's account when an 
   item in their file is declared lost. The amount depends on the 
   :ref:`item's 'replacement cost' field <adding-items-label>` or on 
   the :ref:`item type's default replacement cost <adding-item-types-label>`. 
   It can also be added manually in the :ref:`manual invoices 
   <creating-manual-invoices-label>` tab.

-  MANUAL (Manual fee): this is the default manual fee installed with 
   Koha. This is not charged automatically by Koha, but can be added 
   to a patron's account manually in the :ref:`manual invoices 
   <creating-manual-invoices-label>` tab.

-  NEW\_CARD (New card fee): this is another default manual fee installed 
   with Koha. This will not be charged automatically by Koha, but can 
   be added to a patron's account manually in the :ref:`manual invoices 
   <creating-manual-invoices-label>` tab.

-  OVERDUE (Overdue fine): this is charged automatically to the patron's 
   account when they have overdue items. The amount for overdue fines are

   reimburses the patron (for an over payment for example).

-  PROCESSING (Lost item processing fee): this is charged automatically 
   to the patron's account when an item in their file is declared lost. 
   The amount is set by :ref:`item type <adding-item-types-label>` under 
   'Processing fee (when lost)'.

-  RENT (Rental fee): this is charged automatically to the patron's 
   account upon checkout if the :ref:`item type <adding-item-types-label>` 
   has a rental charge.

   patron's account upon checkout if the :ref:`item type <adding-item-types-label>` 
   has a daily rental charge.

-  RENT\_DAILY\_RENEW (Renewal of daily rental item): this is charged 
   automatically to the patron's account upon renewal if the 
   :ref:`item type <adding-item-types-label>` has a daily rental charge.

   account upon placing a hold. The amount depends on the 'Hold fee' 
   amount in the :ref:`patron's category <adding-a-patron-category-label>` 
   settings.

-  RESERVE\_EXPIRED (Hold waiting too long): this is charged automatically 
   to the patron's account if they haven't picked up their hold after the 
   number of days defined in the :ref:`ExpireReservesMaxPickUpDelay <ExpireReservesMaxPickUpDelay-label>`

MARC bibliographic frameworks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Think of frameworks as templates for creating new bibliographic records.
Koha comes with some predefined frameworks that can be edited or
deleted, and librarians can create their own frameworks for content
specific to their libraries.

-  *Get there:* More > Administration > Catalog > MARC bibliographic
   frameworks

|frameworks|

    **Important**

    Do not delete or edit the Default framework since this will cause
    problems with your cataloging records - always create a new template
    based on the Default framework, or alter the other frameworks.

.. Is the above still true? CCLR 2023-04-28

.. Note::

   This section will only be available to staff members with the
   manage\_marc\_frameworks (or superlibrarian) :ref:`permission <patron-permissions-label>`.

   -  Code: enter a code of 4 or fewer characters, avoiding spaces, diacritics,
      or other special characters.

   -  Description: enter a more detailed definition of your framework, this is
      what will be displayed in Koha.

-  Click 'Submit'

-  Once your framework is added click 'Actions' to the right of
   it on the list of frameworks and choose 'MARC structure'

   -  You will be asked to choose a framework to base your new framework
      on, this will make it easier than starting from scratch

   |startnewframework|

-  Once your framework appears on the screen you can edit or delete each
   field by following the instructions for :ref:`editing fields and
   subfields <edit-framework-fields-and-subfields-label>`

.. _edit-existing-frameworks-label:

Editing existing frameworks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Clicking 'Actions' and then 'Edit' to the right of a framework will only allow
you to edit the description for the framework.

|editframework|

.. _edit-framework-fields-and-subfields-label:

Editing framework fields and subfields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Frameworks are made up of MARC fields (tags) and subfields. To make edits to the
fields and subfields associated with the framework you must click on 'Actions'
and then 'MARC structure'.

.. Important::

   Whenever you make changes to the framework fields and subfields, make sure
   to run the :ref:`MARC bibliographic framework test <marc-bibliographic-framework-test-label>`.

.. _edit-a-marc-field-label:

Editing a MARC field (tag)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

After clicking on 'MARC structure' you will be taken to a screen listing all the
available tags for that framework and you can search for the tag you need. To
make edits to a MARC **field** click on 'Actions' on the right of the field and
choose 'Edit tag'.

|editfield|

The next screen shows details of the tag.

-  Tag: the MARC tag, or field number, is uneditable.

-  Label for lib: text that will show in the staff interface MARC view, and in
   the :ref:`basic editor <basic-editor-cataloging-label>` if the
   :ref:`advancedMARCeditor <advancedMARCeditor-label>` system preference is
   set to display labels.

   .. Note::

      If you use XSLT (see the
      :ref:`XSLTDetailsDisplay <XSLTDetailsDisplay-label>` system preference),
      the labels for the 'Normal' view are defined in the XSLT stylesheet.

      This will not affect the 'Normal' view unless you don't use XSLT.

-  Label for OPAC: text that will show on the MARC view in the OPAC.

   .. Note::

      If you use XSLT (see the
      :ref:`OPACXSLTDetailsDisplay <OPACXSLTDetailsDisplay-label>` system
      preference), the labels for the 'Normal' view are defined in the XSLT
      stylesheet.

      This will not affect the 'Normal' view unless you don't use XSLT.

-  Repeatable: when checked, the field will have an icon next to it in
   the :ref:`basic editor <basic-editor-cataloging-label>`, allowing
   you to add multiples of that tag.

-  Mandatory: when checked, the record cannot be saved unless the field has a
   value. In the :ref:`basic editor <basic-editor-cataloging-label>`, a
   'Required' flag will display as a prompt.

-  Important: when checked, the field will generate a warning if it is not
   filled, but unlike 'Mandatory', you will still be able to save your record
   nonetheless. In the :ref:`basic editor <basic-editor-cataloging-label>`, an
   'Important' flag will display as a prompt.

-  Indicator default values: add default values for indicators here so that they
   will be pre-filled to save time when cataloging, but can still be edited if
   required.

-  Authorized value: define an :ref:`authorized value <authorized-values-label>`
   pull down list for the catalogers

   .. Warning::

      The authorized value option at field level does not work.

Click 'Save changes' to save any modification.

.. _edit-a-marc-subfield-label:

Editing a MARC subfield
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

To edit the **subfields** associated with the tag, click 'Actions' then 'Edit 
subfields' to the right of the tag on the framework field list. Each subfield 
has its own tab which contains three sections - Basic constraints, Advanced 
constraints and Other options.

|editsubfield|

-  For each subfield you can set the following basic constraint options

   -  Subfield code: this is the MARC subfield code, this wouldn't normally be 
      changed.

   -  Text for librarian: text that will show in the staff interface MARC view,
      and in the :ref:`basic editor <basic-editor-cataloging-label>` if the
      :ref:`advancedMARCeditor <advancedMARCeditor-label>` system preference is
      set to display labels.

      .. Note::

         If you use XSLT (see the
         :ref:`XSLTDetailsDisplay <XSLTDetailsDisplay-label>` system preference),
         the labels for the 'Normal' view are defined in the XSLT stylesheet.

         This will not affect the 'Normal' view unless you don't use XSLT.

   -  Text for OPAC: text that will show on the MARC view in the OPAC.

      .. Note::

         If left empty, the 'Text for librarian' is used instead

      .. Note::

         If you use XSLT (see the
         :ref:`OPACXSLTDetailsDisplay <OPACXSLTDetailsDisplay-label>` system
         preference), the labels for the 'Normal' view are defined in the XSLT
         stylesheet.

         This will not affect the 'Normal' view unless you don't use XSLT.

   -  Repeatable: when checked, the field will have an icon next to it in
      the :ref:`basic editor <basic-editor-cataloging-label>`, allowing
      you to add multiples of this subfield.

   -  Mandatory: when checked, the record cannot be saved unless the subfield
      has a value. In the :ref:`basic editor <basic-editor-cataloging-label>`, a
      'Required' flag will display as a prompt.

   -  Important: when checked, the field will generate a warning if it is not
      filled, but unlike 'Mandatory', you will still be able to save your record 
      nonetheless. In the :ref:`basic editor <basic-editor-cataloging-label>`, an
      'Important' flag will display as a prompt.

   -  Managed in tab: defines the tab where the subfield is shown.

      .. Important::

         All subfields of a given field must be in the same tab or ignored. 
         Ignore means that the subfield is not managed.

      .. Warning::

         When :ref:`importing records<stage-marc-records-for-import-label>`, or
         editing existing records, subfields that are managed in tab 'ignore'
         will be deleted. If you still wish to keep the subfields, but hide
         them, use the 'Visibility' options below.

-  For each subfield you can set the following advanced constraint options

   -  Default value: defines what you want to appear in the field by default, 
      this will be editable, but it saves time if you use the same text over 
      and over or the same value in a field often.

      .. Note::
    
         There are several values that you can use here that will be replaced
         automatically when a new record is created:
             
         -  <<MM>> - the current month, 2 digits

         -  <<DD>> - the current day of month, 2 digits

         -  <<YY>> - the current year, 2 digits

         -  <<YYYY>> - the current year, 4 digits

         -  <<USER>> - the username of the currently logged in user
             
         For example: a default of "<<MM>>/<<DD>>/<<YYYY>>"
         (without quotes) will print the current date in the form of
         "01/21/2021"

      .. Note::

         When those default values are filled depends on the
         :ref:`ApplyFrameworkDefaults <applyframeworkdefaults-label>`
         system preference.

   -  Max length: enter a value here to limit the number of characters that can
      be entered in the subfield.

   -  Visibility: allows you to select from where this subfield is
      visible or hidden. Check the boxes where you would like the
      field to show, and uncheck the boxes where you would like it
      hidden.

      -  OPAC: when checked, this will make the subfield available for display
         in the OPAC. For non-XSLT views, the field will be displayed. For XSLT
         views, it will depend on the stylesheet.

      -  Staff interface: when checked, this will make the subfield available
         for display in the staff interface. For non-XSLT views, the field will
         be displayed. For XSLT views, it will depend on the stylesheet.

      -  Editor: when checked, this will make the subfield available for
         modification in the :ref:`basic editor <basic-editor-cataloging-label>`.

      -  Collapsed: when checked, the subfield will be hidden in the
         :ref:`basic editor <basic-editor-cataloging-label>`, but will display
         when the field label is clicked to expand all subfields.

      -  Flagged: when checked, the subfield will be unavailable and hidden from
         all views (equivalent to all boxes being unchecked).

   -  Is a URL: if checked, it means that the subfield is a URL and can be
      clicked.

   -  Link: if you enter an index name here, a link appears after
      the subfield in the MARC detail view in the staff interface.
      If the librarian clicks on the link, a catalog search is done using
      the index and the content of the subfield.

   -  Koha link: this field is used to create a link between the MARC subfield
      and a column in the items, biblioitems, and biblio database tables. The
      mappings can be changed from the
      :ref:`Koha to MARC mapping <koha-to-marc-mapping-label>` page.

-  For each subfield you can set the following Other option values

   -  Authorized value: means the value must be chosen from a drop-down menu
      generated from the :ref:`authorized value <authorized-values-label>` list.

      In the example below, the LANG authorized value category has been set to
      041$a.

      |otheroptions-authval-lang|

      This creates a drop-down menu in the
      :ref:`basic editor <basic-editor-cataloging-label>`.

      |authvalcataloging|

   -  Thesaurus: means that the value is linked to the
      :ref:`authority catalog <authorities-label>` of the selected category.
      Authority categories are managed in the
      :ref:`Authority types <authority-types-label>` section.

   -  Plugin: means the value is calculated or managed by a
      :ref:`cataloguing plugin <valuebuilder-label>`. Cataloguing plugins, or
      value builders, can do almost anything.

      -  Examples:

         -  For call numbers there is an option to add a call number
            browser next to the call number subfield so that you can
            identify which call numbers are in use and which are not.
            Simply choose the cn\_browser.pl plugin. Learn more in the
            :ref:`cataloging section <adding-items-label>` of this manual.

         -  If you'd like to let file uploads via cataloging you can
            choose the upload.pl plugin and this will allow you to
            :ref:`upload files to Koha to link to your
            records <attaching-files-to-records-label>`.

         -  In UNIMARC there are plugins for every 1xx fields that are
            coded fields. The plugin is a huge help for cataloger! There
            are also two plugins (unimarc\_plugin\_210c and
            unimarc\_plugin\_225a that can "magically" find the editor
            from an ISBN, and the collection list for the editor)

         -  If you would like to enable an autocomplete search for publishers 
            in 260b and 264b you can set the plugin to marc21_field_260b.pl.  When you start 
            typing in a publisher name you will be given search results based on publisher 
            names already in the catalog.

-  To save your changes, click 'Save changes'.

.. Tip::

   You can drag and drop the subfield tabs to change the order in which they
   appear when :ref:`cataloging with the basic editor <basic-editor-cataloging-label>`.

   By default, they will appear in alphanumeric order (0-9, then a-z).

.. _add-fields-to-frameworks-label:

Adding fields to frameworks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If a framework doesn't contain a field that you require, you may need to add it.
To add a field to a framework click the 'New tag' button at the top of
the framework definition.

|marcframework|

This will open up a blank form for entering MARC field data

|newtagform|

Enter the field number for your new tag. The process for entering the
remainder of the settings for the new tag is the same as those found in
the :ref:`editing fields and subfields in frameworks <edit-framework-fields-and-subfields-label>`
section of this manual.

When you're finished, click 'Save changes' and your new tag will be displayed 
in the framework field list.

You will need to add at least one subfield to your new tag before it will appear 
in your framework when you are cataloging.

Click on the 'Actions' button for your new tag and then 'Edit subfields'. Click
on the 'New' tab and enter your subfield code.  The process for entering the
remainder of the settings for the new subfield is the same as those found in

To export a framework, click the 'Export' option in the 'Actions' button to the
right of the framework title.

|frameworkactions|

When you click 'Export' you will be prompted to choose what format to
export the file in.

|exportoptions|

A framework exported this way can be imported into any other Koha
installation using the import framework option.

.. _import-framework-label:

Import framework
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

An easy way to create a new framework is to import one created for your
or another Koha installation. This framework would need to be exported
from the other system :ref:`using the instructions
above <export-framework-label>` to be available for import here.

To import a framework you first need to create :ref:`a new
framework <add-new-framework-label>`. Once you have that framework, click
'Actions' then 'Import' to the right of the new framework.

|frameworkactions|

You will be prompted to find a file on your computer to import into the
framework.

|importfile|

You will be asked to confirm your actions before the file is imported.

|importconfirm|

As your file is uploaded, you will see a spinning icon to indicate that
the system is working.

|importtimer|

Once your import is complete you will be brought to the framework edit
tool where you can :ref:`make any changes <edit-framework-fields-and-subfields-label>`
you need to the framework you imported.

.. _koha-to-marc-mapping-label:

Koha to MARC mapping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While Koha stores the entire MARC record, it also stores common fields
for easy access in various tables in the database (mainly the items,
biblioitems, and biblio tables). Koha to MARC mapping
is used to tell Koha where to find these values in the MARC record. Whenever a
record is added or changed, this mapping will be used to update the linked
database column. The information from the database columns is used as a way to
quickly look up important information without having to parse the full MARC
record. It is used for displaying information in a lot of pages and can also be
used in reports.

In many cases, you will not have to change the default values set at the time
of the installation, but it is important to know that the tool is here
and can be used at any time.

.. Warning::

   If you change mappings after data has been added to your catalog, ask your
   system administrator to run misc/batchRebuildBiblioTables.pl. This will
   update the values in the database columns for all your records.

-  *Get there:* More > Administration > Catalog > Koha to MARC mapping

.. Note::

   This section will only be available to staff members with the
   manage\_marc\_frameworks (or superlibrarian) :ref:`permission <patron-permissions-label>`.

The table shows all the database fields that can be mapped to MARC fields.

|kohamarcmapping|

To add a new mapping, click on the 'Add' button to the right of the
appropriate field.

|mapmarc|

Write in the MARC field and subfield you would like to map, separated
by a comma, to this Koha field (for example, "264,a") and click the 'OK' button.

.. Note::

   It is possible to link more than one MARC field to a database field.
   For example, you could link both 260$a and 264$a to the biblioitems.place
   field.

If you would like to clear the mapping for a database field, click
the 'Remove' button.

.. Note::

   All changes are immediate. Records created or edited after the change will
   immediately have the new mappings. However, if you want to update the mappings
   for records already in the catalog, ask your system administrator to run
   misc/batchRebuildBiblioTables.pl. This will update the values in the database
   columns for all your records.

Authority types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Authority types are basically MARC frameworks for authority records and
because of that they follow the same editing rules found in the :ref:`MARC
bibliographic frameworks <marc-bibliographic-frameworks-label>` section of this manual.
Koha comes with many of the necessary authority frameworks already
installed. To learn how to add and edit authority types, simply review
the :ref:`MARC bibliographic frameworks <marc-bibliographic-frameworks-label>` section of this manual.

Commonly used classification sources are:

-  ddc - Dewey Decimal Classification

-  lcc - Library of Congress Classification

If you chose to install classification sources during Koha's
installation, you would see other values too:

-  ANSCR (sound recordings)

-  SuDOC classification

-  Universal Decimal Classification

-  Other/Generic Classification

Classification filing rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Filing rules determine the order in which items are placed on shelves. Filing 
rules normalize call numbers in order for Koha to be able to compare them and 
sort them in the right order.

For example, a Dewey call number such as '636.8/07 SHAW' will become 
'636_800000000000000_07_SHAW' in order to be sorted.

The sorted call number is saved in the items.cn\_sort or biblioitems.cn\_sort 
fields in the database

Values that are pre-configured in Koha are:

-  Dewey

-  LCC

-  Generic

Filing rules are mapped to 
:ref:`Classification sources <adding/editing-classification-sources-label>`. 
You can setup new filing rules by using the 'New filing rule' button. To edit, 
use the 'Edit' button.

When creating or editing:

-  Enter a code. The code is limited to 10 characters and must be unique.

.. Note::
   The code is not editable once it has been created.

-  Enter a description. The description is used in the drop-down list when 
   :ref:`creating or editing a classification source <adding/editing-classification-sources-label>`.

-  Choose an appropriate filing routine - dewey, generic or lcc

   -  The Dewey filing routine generates a sorted call number by following 
      these rules:

      -  Concatenates classification and item parts.

      -  Converts to uppercase.

      -  Removes any leading or trailing white spaces, and forward slashes (\/)

      -  Separates alphabetic prefix from the rest of the call number

      -  Splits into tokens on white spaces and periods.

      -  Leaves first digit group as is.

      -  Converts second digit group to 15-digit long group, padded on right 
         with zeroes.

      -  Converts each whitespace to an underscore.

      -  Removes any remaining non-alphabetical, non-numeric, non-underscore 
         characters.

   -  The generic filing routine generates a sorted call number by following 
      these rules:
      
      -  Concatenates classification and item parts.

      -  Removes any leading or trailing white spaces.

      -  Converts each whitespace to an underscore.

      -  Converts to uppercase.

.. _classification-splitting-rules-label:

Classification splitting rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Splitting rules determine how call numbers are split when printed on a spine 
label.

.. Note::
   Splitting rules are only used if your :ref:`label layout <label-layouts-label>` 
   specifies to split call numbers.

For example, a Dewey call number such as '636.8/07 SHAW' will become 
::

   636.807
   SHAW

once printed on a spine label.

Values that are pre-configured in Koha are:

-  Dewey

-  LCC

-  Generic

Splitting rules are mapped to 
:ref:`Classification sources <adding/editing-classification-sources-label>`. 
You can setup new splitting rules by using the 'New splitting rule' button. To 
edit, use the 'Edit' button.

When creating or editing:

-  Enter a code. The code is limited to 10 characters and must be unique.

.. Note::
   The code is not editable once it has been created.

-  Enter a description. The description is used in the drop-down list when 
   :ref:`creating or editing a classification source <adding/editing-classification-sources-label>`.

-  Choose an appropriate splitting routine - Dewey, Generic, LCC or RegEx

   -  The Dewey splitting routine looks for the three digits and the decimal, 
      puts it on one line with the other parts (Cutter, prefix, etc.) each on 
      a separate line (generally split on spaces).

   -  The Generic splitting routine splits on spaces.

   -  The LCC splitting routine puts each component on a separate line.

   -  The RegEx splitting routine allows you to create a custom splitting 
      routine.

      -  Some examples of RegEx splitting routines:

         -  Split on spaces::

             s/\s/\n/g         

         -  Split on equal signs (=)::

             s/(\s?=)/\n=/g

         -  Split on forward slashes (\/)::

             s/(\s?\/)/\n/g

         -  Remove first split if call number starts with J or K::

             s/^(J|K)\n/$1 /

         -  Cut after 9 characters::

             s/(^.{9})/$1\n/


It is possible to mix and match RegEx splitting routines by clicking the 
'New' link just under the RegEx input box.

For example, if you want to cut after nine characters AND split on spaces, 
you can write both and the call number '971.42805092 C669r' will be split

::

  971.42805
  092
  C669r

.. _record-matching-rules-label:

Record matching rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Record matching rules are used when importing MARC records into Koha.

-  *Get there:* More > Administration > Catalog > Record matching rules

The rules that you set up here will be referenced with you :ref:`Stage MARC
records for import <stage-marc-records-for-import-label>`.

It is important to understand the difference between 'Match points' and
'Match checks' before adding new matching rules to Koha.

Match points are the criteria that you enter that must be met in order
for an incoming record to match an existing MARC record in your catalog.
You can have multiple match points on an import rule each with its own
score. An incoming record will be compared against your existing records
('one record at a time') and given a score for each match point. When
the total score of the match points matches or exceeds the threshold
given for the matching rule, Koha assumes a good match and
imports/overlays according your specifications in the import process. An
area to watch out for here is the sum of the match points. Double check
that the matches you want will add up to a successful match.

Example:

Threshold of 1000

Match point on 020$a 1000

Match point on 022$a 1000

Match point on 245$a 500

Match point on 100$a 100

In the example above, a match on either the 020$a or the 022$a will
result in a successful match. A match on 245$a title and 100$a author
(and not on 020$a or 022$a) will only add up to 600 and not be a match.
And a match on 020$a and 245$a will result in 1500 and while this is a
successful match, the extra 500 point for the 245$a title match are
superfluous. The incoming record successfully matched on the 020$a
without the need for the 245$a match. However, if you assigned a score
of 500 to the 100$a Match Point, a match on 245$a title and 100$a author
will be considered a successful match (total of 1000) even if the 020$a
is not a match.

Match checks are not commonly used in import rules. However, they can
serve a couple of purposes in matching records. First, match checks can
be used as the matching criteria instead of the match points if your
indexes are stale and out of date. The match checks go right for the
data instead of relying on the data in the indexes. (If you fear your
indexes are out of date, a rebuild of your indexes would be a great idea
and solve that situation!) The other use for a match check is as a
'double check' or 'veto' of your matching rule. For example, if you have
a matching rule as below:

Threshold of 1000

Match point on 020$a 1000

Match check on 245$a

Koha will first look at the 020$a tag/subfield to see if the incoming
record matches an existing record. If it does, it will then move on to
the Match Check and look directly at the 245$a value in the incoming
data and compare it to the 245$a in the existing 'matched' record in
your catalog. If the 245$a matches, Koha continues on as if a match was
successful. If the 245$a does not match, then Koha concludes that the
two records are not a match after all. The Match Checks can be a really
useful tool in confirming true matches.

When looking to create matching rules for your authority records the
following indexes will be of use:

+--------------------------+--------------------+
| Index name               | Matches MARC tag   |
+==========================+====================+
| LC-cardnumber            | 010$a              |

.. _adding-matching-rules-label:

Adding matching rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create a new matching rule :

-  Click 'New record matching rule'

   |newmatchrule|

   -  Choose a unique name and enter it in the 'Matching rule code'
      field

   -  'Description' can be anything you want to make it clear to you
      what rule you're picking

   -  'Match threshold' is the total number of 'points' a biblio must
      earn to be considered a 'match'

   -  'Record type' is the type of import this rule will be used for -
      either authority or bibliographic

   -  Match points are set up to determine what fields to match on

   -  'Search index' can be found by looking at the index configuration
      on your system. For Zebra you might find the right index names
      in your ccl.properties file. You can also find useful information in
      the :ref:`Koha search indexes <koha-search-indexes-label>` chapter of this manual.

   -  'Score' - The number of 'points' a match on this field is worth.
      If the sum of each score is equal or greater than the match threshold, the
      incoming record is a match to the existing record.

   -  Enter the MARC tag you want to match on in the 'Tag' field.

   -  Enter the MARC tag subfield you want to match on in the
      'Subfields' field. For matching on controlfields like 001 the subfields
      input field can be left empty.

   -  'Offset' - For use with control fields, 001-009

   -  'Length' - For use with control fields, 001-009

   -  There are currently several options for 'Normalization rules':

      - None - no normalization rule will be applied

      - Remove spaces

      - Uppercase

      - Lowercase

      - Legacy default - this option was added to maintain the behavior
        form before the other normalization rules became available.

      - ISBN - using this option will improve matching on ISBN. If your
        incoming records ISBN fields contain extra text, like
        '9780670026623 (alk. paper)', they will still match correctly.

   -  'Required match checks' - While match points work on the search
      index, match checks work directly on the data and can be used
      as the matching criteria instead of the match points or in addition
      to them to confirm true matches.

.. _record-overlay-rules-label:

Record overlay rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Record overlay rules allow for defining rules for how incoming and original
MARC records should be merged on a field tag and context basis when a MARC 
record is updated.

Contexts
^^^^^^^^

Let's first focus on understanding the concept of contexts.

Contexts are defined by "module" and "filter" enabling separate rule sets for
different contexts.

By setting different filter values for these modules, rules are applied only
when the filter value matches for a particular module. A wildcard; "*", can
be used to match all possible filter values.

There are three different context modules:

borrower
  Allows for defining rules that will be applied if the currently logged
  in user's borrower number matches the filter condition.

categorycode
  Allows for defining rules that will be applied if the currently
  logged in users's category code matches the filter condition.

source
  Allows for defining rules that will be applied if the record is updated
  in a particular part of Koha. The following update methods are supported:

    - batchimport

    - z39.50

    - intranet

    - bulkmarcimport

    - import_lexile

    - batchmod

A context is really nothing but a module and filter combination. Every time
a record is updated i Koha, a context is set an filter values populated with
context dependent values.

Examples of two different contexts are saving record in the staff client or the
currently logged in user having a particular borrower number, for example "12".

These two contexts are define as:

::

  Module: source, filter: intranet
  Module: borrower, filter: 12

Only the rules of one context, that is a module and filter combination,
are applied. If multiple contexts matches they are *not* merged together.

If we have the following rules:

::

  Module: source, filter: *, tag: 650, preset: Protect
  Module: source, filter: *, tag: 500, preset: Protect
  Module: borrower, filter: 12, tag: *, preset: Overwrite

And the context of the update where the rules are applied is:

::

  source => "intranet" (wildcard match)
  borrower => 1 (no match)

Only the first two rules will be applied.

If instead the context of rule evaluation was:

::

  source => "intranet" (wildcard match)
  borrower => 12 (an exact match, which is considered more specific than a wildcard match)

Only the second rule would be applied, even though the first two rules also
matches they will be discarded since the context match of that rule set is of
lower specificity because of the wildcard.

Context specificity is ranked in the following way:

  - First all the rules are grouped into rule sets identified by a unique filter
    and module combination.

  - If one or more contexts have a non wildcard filter condition match, the rule
    set of the context with the module of highest specificity is selected. (The
    modules are listed in order of specificity above).

  - If no exact context match is found, but one or more wildcard matches are,
    the rule set of the context with the module of highest specificity is
    selected.

  - If no context matches the default behavior is to overwrite, the original
    record with the incoming record.

Rules
^^^^^

A rule consists of a three different parts:

Context
  A module and filter to match against as described above.

Tag
  A field tag expression for defining which tag(s) the rule should be applied on.
  Three different tag expressions are supported:

    - An exact tag, for example "650".
    - A regular expression, for example "6.." matching all 6XX tags.
    - A wildcard, "*", matching all tags

When rules for a specific context are evaluated, the most specific match is selected.
The tag expressions above are listed in order of specificity.

Actions
  Each rule defines a set of actions to take depending on the type of update.
  There are four types of update events: Added, Appended, Removed and Deleted.
  For each event an action is specified, whether to perform the update, or to
  skip it.

By enabling/disabling updates for these different events 16 different update
behaviours can be defined. There are presets available for the most
common/useful combinations:


=====================  ========  ========  ========  ========
        Preset         Added     Appended  Removed   Deleted
=====================  ========  ========  ========  ========
Protect                Skip      Skip      Skip      Skip
Overwrite              Add       Append    Remove    Delete
Add new                Add       Skip      Skip      Skip
Add and append         Add       Append    Skip      Skip
Protect from deletion  Add       Append    Remove    Delete
=====================  ========  ========  ========  ========


Protect
^^^^^^^

::

  Added: Skip, Appended: Skip, Removed: Skip, Deleted: Skip

The "Protect" preset will prevent all updates on matching fields, protecting
them from being overwritten.

Given this rule:

::

  Module: source, filter: *, Tag: 650, Preset: Protect

And the following original and incoming records:

::

  100 1#$aTerrace, Vincent,$d1948-
  650 #0$aTelevision serials$zUnited States$vCatalogs.


::

  100 1#$aTerrace, Vincent,$d1948-
  500 ##$aIncludes index.
  650 #0$aTelevision pilot programs$zUnited States$vCatalogs.


The 650 field of the original record will retain its original value after the
update (but since the default behaviour if no rule matches is to overwrite, the
500 field will be added):

::

  100 1#$aTerrace, Vincent,$d1948-
  500 ##$aIncludes index.
  650 #0$aTelevision serials$zUnited States$vCatalogs.

Overwrite
^^^^^^^^^

::

  Added: Add, Appended: Append, Removed: Remove, Deleted: Delete

The "Overwrite" preset will allow all updates on matching fields.

Since the default behavior is to overwrite if no rule matches, adding a rule
with the overwrite preset only makes sense if there is some other rule with a
lower tag specificity with a different behavior, for example a wildcard tag
rule.

So given these two rules:

::

  Module: source, filter: *, Tag: *, Preset: Protect
  Module: source, filter: *, Tag: 650, Preset: Overwrite

And the following original and incoming records:

::

  500 ##$aIncludes index.
  650 #0$aTelevision serials$zUnited States$vCatalogs.

Incoming record:

::

  100 1#$aTerrace, Vincent,$d1948-
  500 ##$aIncludes index.
  650 #0$aTelevision pilot programs$zUnited States$vCatalogs.

All fields but 650 will be protected on the original record, and the resulting
record will be:

::

  500 ##$aIncludes index.
  650 #0$aTelevision pilot programs$zUnited States$vCatalogs.

Add new
^^^^^^^

::

  Added: Add, Appended: Skip, Removed: Skip, Deleted: Skip

The "Add new" allow updates only if the incoming field is new, that is there
exists no fields with this tag in the original record.

Given this rule:

::

  Module: source, filter: *, Tag: 650, Preset: Add

And the following original and incoming records:

::

  100 1#$aTerrace, Vincent,$d1948-
  650 #0$aTelevision serials$zUnited States$vCatalogs.


::

  100 1#$aTerrace, Vincent,$d1948-
  500 ##$aIncludes index.
  650 #0$aTelevision pilot programs$zUnited States$vCatalogs.

The 650 in the incoming record will not overwrite the 650 field in the original
record since the original record contains one or more 650 fields. The 500 field
will be added since the default rule is to overwrite. The resulting record will
be:

::

  100 1#$aTerrace, Vincent,$d1948-
  500 ##$aIncludes index.
  650 #0$aTelevision serials$zUnited States$vCatalogs.

On the other hand, if the original record was:

::

  100 1#$aTerrace, Vincent,$d1948-

The resulting record will be:

::

  100 1#$aTerrace, Vincent,$d1948-
  500 ##$aIncludes index.
  650 #0$aTelevision pilot programs$zUnited States$vCatalogs.

This is because there were no 650 fields in the original record, so adding new
ones is permitted.

Add and append
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

  Added: Add, Appended: Append, Removed: Skip, Deleted: Skip

In the "Add and append" preset, appending is also permitted, but not removing or
deleting.

So if we have the following rule:

::

  Module: source, filter: *, Tag: 650, Preset: Add and append

And the following original and incoming records:

::

  100 1#$aTerrace, Vincent,$d1948-
  650 #0$aTelevision serials$zUnited States$vCatalogs.


::

  100 1#$aTerrace, Vincent,$d1948-
  500 ##$aIncludes index.
  650 #0$aTelevision pilot programs$zUnited States$vCatalogs.

The resulting record will be:

::

  100 1#$aTerrace, Vincent,$d1948-
  500 ##$aIncludes index.
  650 #0$aTelevision serials$zUnited States$vCatalogs.
  650 #0$aTelevision pilot programs$zUnited States$vCatalogs.

Note that the "old" 650 field from the original record was not removed since we
only allow adding or appending new values.

If we instead used the "Overwrite" preset the resulting record would instead be:

::

  100 1#$aTerrace, Vincent,$d1948-
  500 ##$aIncludes index.
  650 #0$aTelevision pilot programs$zUnited States$vCatalogs.

with the 650 field of the original record removed.

Protect from deletion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

  Added: Add, Appended: Append, Removed: Remove, Deleted: Skip

The preset "Protect from deletion" will allow all update operations except
deletion. Deletion is defined as when there are no fields of the matching tag
in the incoming record so that all of the fields with this tag would be removed
on the original record.

So given the following rule:

::

  Module: source, filter: *, Tag: 650, Preset: Protect from deletion

And the following original and incoming records:

::

  100 1#$aTerrace, Vincent,$d1948-
  650 #0$aTelevision serials$zUnited States$vCatalogs.

::

  100 1#$aTerrace, Vincent,$d1948-
  500 ##$aIncludes index.
  650 #0$aTelevision pilot programs$zUnited States$vCatalogs.

The resulting record will be:

::

  100 1#$aTerrace, Vincent,$d1948-
  500 ##$aIncludes index.
  650 #0$aTelevision pilot programs$zUnited States$vCatalogs.

On the other hand, if the incoming record was:

::

  100 1#$aTerrace, Vincent,$d1948-
  500 ##$aIncludes index.

In this case the deletion of 650 would not be permitted and the value of the
field on the original record would be protected. The resulting record would
instead be:

::

  100 1#$aTerrace, Vincent,$d1948-
  500 ##$aIncludes index.
  650 #0$aTelevision serials$zUnited States$vCatalogs.

Custom presets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To work with custom presets, a more complete understanding of the update events
is required:

Added
  For a matching rule with a tag, the action configured for the "Added" event is
  applied for new fields in the incoming record if the original record has no
  fields with that tag.  If the action is "Add" they will be added to the
  original record, if "Skip" they will be thrown away.

Appended
  If the two record have common fields with the rule tag, that is one or more
  fields with identical subfield and identifier values, the action configured
  for the "Appended" event is applied for fields found in incoming
  record but not in original record. If the action is "Append" they will be
  added to the original record, if "Skip" they will be thrown away.

Removed
  If the two records have common fields with the rule tag, the action
  configured for the "Removed" action is applied for fields found in original
  record but not in incoming record. If the action is "Remove" they will
  removed from the original record, if "Skip" they will be kept.

Deleted
  If the original record have fields with the rule tag, but no fields with this
  tag is found in the incoming record, the action configured for the "Deleted"
  event is applied for the fields in the incoming record. If the action is
  "Delete" the fields will be removed from the original record, if "Skip" they
  will be kept.


.. _oai-sets-configuration-label:

OAI sets configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On this page you can create, modify and delete OAI-PMH sets

.. _create-a-set-label:

Create a set
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create a set:

-  Click on the link 'Add a new set'

-  Fill the mandatory fields 'setSpec' and 'setName'

-  Then you can add descriptions for this set. To do this click on 'Add
   description' and fill the newly created text box. You can add as many
   descriptions as you want.

-  Click on 'Save' button'

.. _modify/delete-a-set-label:

Modify/delete a set
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To modify a set, just click on the link 'Modify' on the same line of the
set you want to modify. A form similar to set creation form will appear
and allow you to modify the setSpec, setName and descriptions.

To delete a set, just click on the link 'Delete' on the same line of the
set you want to delete.

.. _define-mappings-label:

Define mappings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here you can define how a set will be build (what records will belong to
this set) by defining mappings. Mappings are a list of conditions on
record content.

-  Fill the fields 'Field', 'Subfield' and 'Value'. For example if you
   want to include in this set all records that have a 999$9 equal to
   'XXX'. Fill 'Field' with 999, 'Subfield' with 9 and 'Value' with XXX.

-  If you want to add another condition, click on 'Add' button and repeat
   step 1. You can choose between 'and' or 'or' Boolean operators to link 
   your conditions.

-  Click on 'Save'

To delete a condition, just leave at least one of 'Field', 'Subfield' or
'Value' empty and click on 'Save'.

    **Note**

    Actually, a condition is true if value in the corresponding subfield
    is strictly equal to what is defined if 'Value'. A record having
    999$9 = 'XXX YYY' will not belong to a set where condition is 999$9
    = 'XXX'.

And it is case sensitive : a record having 999$9 = 'xxx' will not belong
to a set where condition is 999$9 = 'XXX'.

.. _build-sets-label:

Build sets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have configured all your sets, you have to build the sets. This
is done by calling the script misc/migration\_tools/build\_oai\_sets.pl.

.. _item-search-fields-label:

Item search fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From here you can add custom search fields to the :ref:`item
search <item-searching-label>` option in the staff client.

    |image1205|

To add a new search term simply click the 'New search field' button

    |image1206|

-  Name is a field for you to identify the search term

-  Label is what will appear on the item search page

-  MARC field allows you to pick which field you'd like to search in

-  MARC subfield is the subfield you'd like to search in

-  Authorized values category can be used to turn this search field in
   to a pull down instead of a free text field

Once your new field is added it will be visible at the top of this page
and on the item search page

    |image1207|

.. _search-filter-administration-label:

Search filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Search filters are custom searches or filters that can be applied to search
results.

This functionality is enabled on using the
:ref:`SavedSearchFilters <savedsearchfilters-label>` system preference.

.. Note::

   This section will only be visible if the
   :ref:`SavedSearchFilters <savedsearchfilters-label>` system preference is
   enabled and you have the manage\_search\_filters (or superlibrarian)
   :ref:`permission <patron-permissions-defined-label>`.

Search filters are added by
:ref:`searching the catalog through the staff interface <adding-search-filters-label>`.

This page is used to manage existing search filters.

|searchfiltersadmin|

You can make changes to each search filter by clicking on the action buttons on
the right.

-  Edit filter: change the name of the filter, and its availability in the OPAC
   or staff interface

   |editsearchfilter|

-  Edit search: clicking this button will bring you to the
   :ref:`advanced search form <advanced-searching-label>`, with the filter
   already applied. You can change the search parameters, and click 'Save filter'
   at the top of the page.

   |editfiltersearch|

-  Delete: clicking this button will delete the filter.

   .. Warning::

      There is no confirmation when deleting a search filter. Once you click
      'Delete', the filter will be deleted immediately.

.. Note::

   Search filters can be used as pre-defined search URLs that you can use on
   your website or in :ref:`HTML customizations <html-customizations-label>`.

   Search filters are available through relatively short links.

   :code:`<OPACBaseURL>/cgi-bin/koha/opac-search.pl?limit=search_filter:<Id of filter>`

   Use this URL anywhere to link directly to the search.

.. _search-engine-configuration:

Search engine configuration
----------------------------
Once you have switched to Elasticsearch in your SearchEngine system preference,
you’ll see a new link for Search engine configuration in the Catalog section of 
Administration. Here you will manage indexes, facets, and their mappings to MARC
fields and subfields.

.. _acquisitions-module-label:

Acquisitions
----------------------------

The Koha Acquisitions module provides a way for the library to record
orders placed with vendors and manage purchase budgets.

Before using the `Acquisitions Module <#acqmodule>`__, you will want to
make sure that you have completed all of the set up.

-  *Get there:* More > Administration > Acquisitions

.. _currencies-and-exchange-rates-label:

Currencies and exchange rates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you place orders from more than one country you will want to input
currency exchange rates so that your acquisitions module will properly
calculate totals.

-  *Get there:* More > Administration > Acquisitions > Currencies and
   exchange rates

|currencies|

.. Note::

   You can customize the columns of this table in the
   :ref:`'Table settings'<column-settings-label>` section of the
   Administration module (table id: currency).

-  Currency: this is the code for the currency. For default currencies, the
   ISO code is used as currency code (for example 'USD' for the US dollar).
   The ISO code will be used when importing MARC files via the
   :ref:`staging tools <stage-marc-records-for-import-label>`. The tool will
   attempt to find and use the price of the currently active currency.

-  Rate: the rate will be used to calculate the price in the active currency.

   .. Note::

      This data is not automatically updated, so be sure to keep it up to
      date so that your accounting is kept correct.

-  Symbol: this is the symbol for the currency (for example, $ for USD, or €
   for EUR).

-  Last updated: this is the date when the currency was last updated in Koha.

-  Active: the active currency is the main currency you use in your library. The
   active currency will have a check mark in the 'Active' column. If you
   don't have an active currency you will see an error message telling you
   to choose an active currency.

   |nocurrency|

   The active currency must have a rate of 1. There can only be one active
   currency.

-  Archived: archived currencies will have 'Yes' in this column. Archived
   currencies cannot be used in the acquisitions module.

   .. Note::

      It is currently not possible to manually archive currencies. Currencies
      will be archived if Koha is updated and a currency that was used
      previously in the acquisitions module was deleted.

-  Actions: use the buttons to edit or delete currencies.

   .. Note::

      If a currency was used at least once, it will not be possible to delete
      it.

.. _add-currency-label:

Adding a new currency
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If a currency that you use is not already in your system, you can create it.

-  Click 'New currency'.

|newcurrency|

-  Fill out the form.

   -  Currency: enter a code for the currency, this can be the ISO code, or
      another code. This is what will be displayed in the
      :ref:`acquisitions module <acquisitions-label>`.

      .. Note::

         If you decide to use a custom code here, make sure to fill out the
         ISO code with the correct code for the currency. This will ensure that
         prices are calculated according to the rate.

      .. Note::

         This field is limited to 10 characters.

   -  Rate: enter the rate of this currency relative to your active currency.

   -  Symbol: enter the symbol for the currency (for example, $ for USD, or €
      for EUR).

   -  ISO code: enter the ISO code for the currency (for example 'USD' for the
      US dollar). This field is optional. If this field is empty, Koha will use
      the currency code (above) as the ISO code for price calculations.

   -  Last updated: this will be filled automatically with today's date, it is
      not possible to manually change this date.

   -  Space separation between symbol and value: if checked, Koha will display
      the price with a space before the currency symbol (for example, 10.99 $
      rather than 10.99$).

   -  Active: check this box if this currency is the default currency used in
      the acquisitions module. Note that there can only be one active currency
      and that the active currency's rate must be 1.

-  Click 'Submit'.

.. _edit-currency-label:

Editing a currency
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you often order from other countries, it will be necessary to update the
exchange rate regularly in order to calculate the prices precisely.

To edit an existing currency,

-  Click the 'Edit' button to the right of the currency in the currencies table.

-  Change the rate, or other value.

   .. Note::

      Note that the currency code and the last updated date cannot be edited.

-  Click 'Submit'.

.. _delete-currency-label:

Deleting a currency
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If there are currencies that you never use, it is possible to delete them.

From the currencies table, click the 'Delete' button to the right of the
currency.

.. Warning::

   Currencies that have been used at least once in the
   :ref:`acquisitions module <acquisitions-label>` cannot be deleted.

.. _budgets-label:

Budgets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Budgets are used for tracking accounting values related to :ref:`acquisitions <acquisitions-label>`.
For example you could create a budget for the current year (ex. 2015)
and then break that into :ref:`funds <Funds-label>` for different areas of the
library (ex. Books, Audio, etc).

-  *Get there:* More > Administration > Acquisitions > Budgets

When visiting the main budget administration you will see two tabs, one
for active and one for inactive budgets.

|budgetslist|

.. _adding-budgets-label:

Adding budgets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Budgets can either be created :ref:`from scratch <add-a-new-budget-label>` or by
:ref:`duplicating the previous year's budget <duplicate-a-budget-label>`.

.. _add-a-new-budget-label:

Adding a new budget
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

If you haven't used Koha before for acquisitions, you'll need to
start fresh with a new budget.

To add a new budget,

-  Click the 'New budget' button.

   |newbudgetform|

-  Fill out the form:

   -  Start date (mandatory): choose the starting date for the time period this
      budget is for. This can be the start of the calendar year, fiscal year,
      academic year, quarter, etc.

   -  End date (mandatory): choose the ending date for the time period this
      budget is for.

   -  Description (mandatory): enter a description for this budget. The
      description should be something that will help you identify the budget
      when ordering.

   -  Total amount: enter the amount for the budget. Do not use any symbols,
      simply enter the amount of the budget with numbers and decimals.

   -  Make budget active: marking a budget as active makes it usable when
      placing orders in the :ref:`acquisitions module <acquisitions-label>`,
      even if the order is placed after the budget end date. This will allow
      you to record orders that were placed in a previous budget period.

   -  Lock budget: locking a budget means that you will not be able to
      :ref:`add funds <add-a-fund-label>` or
      :ref:`add sub funds <add-sub-fund-label>` to this budget, and you will
      not be able to :ref:`plan spending <budget-planning-label>`. Lock the
      budget once it is set as you wish.

-  Click 'Save'.

You will be brought back to the list of existing budgets.

Proceed to :ref:`add funds <add-a-fund-label>` to the budget.

.. _duplicate-a-budget-label:

Duplicating a budget
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

At the end of the year, or the end of your budget period, you can duplicate the
current budget. This will also duplicate all funds, so you don't have to start
from scratch each year or period.

To duplicate a budget,

-  From the list of budgets, click the 'Actions' button on the right.

   |budgetslist|

-  Choose 'Duplicate'.

   |budgetactions-duplicate|

Alternatively,

-  From the list of budgets, click on the budget name.

   |budgetslist|

-  On the screen listing the budget breakdown, click the 'Edit' button at the
   top and choose to 'Duplicate budget'.

   |duplicatebudget|

-  In both cases, you will be presented with a form to duplicate the budget.

   |duplicatebudgetform|

   -  Start date (mandatory): choose the starting date for the time period this
      new budget is for.

   -  End date (mandatory): choose the ending date for the time period this
      budget is for.

   -  Description (mandatory): enter a description for this new budget.

   -  Change amounts by: by default, the total amount from the duplicated budget
      and the original amounts for each fund will be used. However, if needed,
      you can indicate to change the amounts by a percentage, that can be
      positive or negative. For example, if your new budget was increased by 2%,
      enter 2. Inversely, if your new budget was decreased by 2%, enter -2.

   -  If amounts changed, round to a multiple of: if you entered a value in
      'Change amounts by', Koha will calculate the amounts automatically. You
      can force it to round down the amounts. For example, entering '100', will
      round down the amounts to the hundreds (5542 will become 5500).

   -  Mark the original budget as inactive: check this box if the original
      budget should no longer be used, effective immediately. You can always
      :ref:`edit the budget <edit-budget-label>` later to make it inactive.

   -  Set all funds to zero: check this box if you wish the new budget to
      contain all the same fund structures as the previous budget but no
      allocations until you manually enter an amount in the fund.

This will not only duplicate the budget, but all of the funds
associated with that budget so that you can reuse budgets and funds from
year to year.

When the time comes, you can
:ref:`close the previous budget <close-a-budget-label>` to move unreceived
orders, and, if desired, unspent funds to the new budget.

.. _edit-budget-label:

Editing a budget
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can edit existing budgets to make them inactive or lock them to prevent

Closing a budget
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Close a budget to move or roll over unreceived orders and if desired
unspent funds from a previous budget to a new budget. Before closing
your budget you might want to :ref:`duplicate the previous year's
budget <duplicate-a-budget-label>` so that you have somewhere for the
unreceived orders to roll to.

To close a budget,

-  From the list of budgets, click the 'Actions' button on the right.

   |budgetslist|

-  Choose 'Close'

   |budgetactions-close|

    .. Note::

       Budgets without unreceived orders cannot be closed.

       |nounreceivedorders|

-  Fill out the form.

   |closebudgetoptions|

   -  Select a budget: choose the new budget for the unreceived orders from the
      dropdown.

      .. Note::

         In order for the unreceived orders to be automatically moved to the
         new budget, the fund structures in the previous budget must exist in
         the new budget.

   -  Move remaining unspent funds: check this box to move the unspent
      amounts from the funds of the budget being closed to the selected
      budget.

-  Click the 'Move unreceived orders' button.

You will be presented with a dialog box that says 'You have
chosen to move all unreceived orders from 'Budget X' to 'Budget Y'. This
action cannot be reversed. Do you wish to continue?' Budget X is the
budget to be closed and Budget Y is the selected budget.

|closewarning|

If everything seems correct click 'OK' and the unreceived orders and, if
selected, unspent funds will be moved.

Wait until the 'Report after moving unreceived orders from budget X to
Y' displays. This will list the order numbers which have been impacted
(grouped by fund) and detail if the unreceived order was moved or if
there was a problem. For example, if the new budget does not contain a
fund with the same name as the previous budget, the order will not be
moved.

      that staff will understand, as this is what will be displayed when ordering.

   -  Amount (mandatory): enter the amount with only numbers and decimals, no
      other characters.

   -  Warning at (%): enter a percentage value to have Koha warn you when you
      have spent this percentage of the fund, to prevent overspending. For
      example, if you enter 90%, Koha will warn you for each order after 90%
      of the fund is spent.

   -  Warning at (amount): same as above but for a specific amount of money
      spent. For example, if you enter 5000, Koha will warn you for each order

         :ref:`Planning category FAQ <faq-planning-categories-label>`.

-  Click 'Submit'.

You will be brought to a list of all of the funds for the budget.

|fundlist|

The monetary columns in the fund table break down as follows:

1. Base-level allocated is the 'Amount' value you defined when creating
   the fund

2. Base-level ordered is the ordered amount for this fund (without child
   funds)

3. Total ordered is the base-level ordered for this fund and all its
   child funds

4. Base-level spent is the spent amount for this fund (without child
   funds)

5. Total spent is the base-level spent for this fund and all its child
   funds

6. Base-level available is 1 - 2

7. Total available is 1 - 3

To the right of each fund you will find the 'Actions' button under which
you will find the 'Edit,' 'Delete,' and 'Add sub fund' options.

|fundactions|

.. _add-sub-fund-label:

Adding a sub fund
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A sub fund is a more granular division of the fund. An example would be
to have a fund for 'Fiction' and under that have a fund for 'New
releases' and a fund for 'Science Fiction.' It is an optional way to
further organize your finances.

.. Note::

   If a budget is locked, it will not be possible to add sub funds.

To add a sub fund to a fund,

-  From the list of all funds, or from the list of funds of a specific budget,
   click the 'Actions' button on the right.

   |fundlist|

-  Choose 'Add sub fund'.

   |fundactions-addsubfund|

-  Fill out the new sub fund form. Fields are the same as for
   :ref:`adding a new fund <add-a-fund-label>`. The only difference is that the
   form will state the 'parent' fund.

-  Click 'Submit'.

Funds with sub funds will show with a small arrow to the left. Clicking
that will show you the sub funds.

|subfunds|

.. _delete-fund-label:

Deleting funds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is possible to delete funds, if necessary.

.. Warning::

   Deleting a fund in which there are orders will delete those orders. Only
   delete funds if you are certain it needs to be deleted. **It is not possible
   to undo this.**

To delete a fund,

-  From the list of all funds, or from the list of funds of a specific budget,
   click the 'Actions' button on the right.

how you would like to plan to spend your budget.

|planningpulldown|

If you choose 'Plan by months' you will see the budgeted amount broken
down by months.

|planningbymonths|

On the left are filters that can be used to limit what is shown in the table.

|planningfilters|

-  Select planning type: choose to plan by months, libraries, itemtypes, or any
   authorized value category used as statistic 1 or 2 in the funds.

-  Show my funds only: this will filter out funds of which you are not the owner.

-  Show active funds only: this will filter out funds that have not been used
   (no ordered amount).

-  Show actual/estimated values: this will alter the table to show the ordered
   amounts as well.

To hide some of the columns, uncheck the boxes at the top of the table.

From here, you can plan your budget spending by manually entering values
or by clicking the 'Auto-fill row' button. If you choose to auto-fill
the form the system will try to divide the amount accordingly, you may
have to make some edits to split things more accurately.

.. _add-identity-provider-label:

Adding an identity provider
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To add an identity provider, click the 'New identity provider' button.

|newidentityprovider|

-  Basic configuration

   -  Code: enter a code for this provider.

      .. Note::

         The code for the identity provider is limited to 20 characters and
         can only be composed of letters, numbers, and underscore (\_).

   -  Description: enter a name for this provider. This is what you will see in
      the interface.

   -  Protocol: choose which protocol this identity provider uses.

      -  OAuth

      -  OIDC

-  Advanced configuration

   -  Configuration: Use this field to enter the configuration specific to the
      protocol chosen above.

      You can click on the 'Add default OAuth configuration' button or the 'Add
      default OIDC configuration' button to prefill the field with some default
      values, which you can change for your own values.

      The default OAuth configuration is::

       {
        "key": "<enter client id>",
        "secret": "<enter client secret>",
        "authorize_url": "<enter authorization endpoint>",
        "token_url": "<enter token endpoint>",
        "userinfo_url": "<enter user info endpoint (optional)>",
        "scope": "email"
       }

      The default OIDC configuration is::

       {
        "key": "<enter client id>",
        "secret": "<enter client secret>",
        "well_known_url": "<enter openid configuration endpoint>",
        "scope": "openid email"
       }

   -  Mapping: Use this field to define the field mappings from the external
      database to the Koha borrower fields.

      The key is the Koha field from the borrowers table, and the value is the
      external field.

      .. Note::

         You can find all fields of the borrowers table in the
         `database schema <https://schema.koha-community.org/>`_.

      You can click on the 'Add default OAuth mapping' button or the 'Add
      default OIDC mapping' button to prefill the field with some default
      values, which you can change for your own values.

      Both the default OAuth mapping and default OIDC mapping are::

       {
        "email": "email",
        "firstname": "given_name",
        "surname": "family_name"
       }

      If the external fields are nested, you can use periods to separate the
      levels.

      For example, if the firstname is nested like so::

       <user>
          <given_name>First name</given_name>
          <family_name>Family name</family_name>
          <email>Email address</email>
       </user>

      Use::

       "firstname": "user.0.given_name"

      This will fetch the "given_name" field in the first "user" field (0 =
      first).

      .. Important::

         If you plan on using the auto register function (see below), make sure
         either "userid" or "cardnumber" are present in the mappings.

      .. Important::

         Make sure the field for the matchpoint (see below) is included in the
         mappings.

   -  Matchpoint: choose which field is used to match incoming users to existing
      users.

      .. Note::

         The field chosen here must be included in the mappings (see above).

   -  Icon URL: if you want an icon to show on the login screen for this
      provider, enter the URL to the image file here.

Z39.50/SRU servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Z39.50 is a client/server protocol for searching and retrieving
information from remote computer databases. In short, it's a tool used
for copy cataloging.

SRU (Search/Retrieve via URL) is a standard XML-based protocol for
search queries, utilizing CQL (Contextual Query Language), a standard
syntax for representing queries.

Using Koha you can connect to any Z39.50 or SRU target that is publicly
available or that you have the log in information to and copy
bibliographic or authority records from that source.

-  *Get there:* More > Administration > Additional parameters >
   Z39.50/SRU servers

Koha comes with a default list of Z39.50/SRU targets set up that you can
add to, edit or delete.

To find additional Z39.50 targets, you can use IndexData's IRSpy:
`http://irspy.indexdata.com <http://irspy.indexdata.com/>`__ or the
Library of Congress's list of targets http://www.loc.gov/z3950/. You can also
contact individual libraries and ask for their Z39.50 information.

-  From the main Z39.50 page, click 'New Z39.50 server'.

   |newz39|

   -  Server name: enter a name that will help you identify the source (such as
      the library name). It will be saved in capital letters.

   -  Hostname: enter the address to the Z39.50 target.

   -  Port: enter the port number to listen on to get results from this target.

   -  Database: enter the name of the database.

   -  Userid: some servers might be password protected. If that is the case for
      the server you are trying to add, enter your user ID for that source.

   -  Password: if the server is password protected, enter your password for
      that source.

   -  Preselected: check this box if you want this target to always be
      selected by default.

   -  Rank: enter a number representing where in the list you'd like this target
      to appear. 0 is the top position, then 1, 2, etc.

      -  If this is left blank the targets will be in alphabetical order.

   -  Attributes: enter PQF attributes to be added to all queries.

   -  Syntax: choose the MARC flavor used by this target.

   -  Encoding: choose the character encoding used by this target.

      .. Note::

         If you notice special characters don't appear correctly when you
         import records through Z39.50, it means the encoding is wrong. Change
         it to another and try importing again.

   -  Timeout: enter a number of seconds after which to stop trying to search
      the target if results aren't found in a reasonable amount of time. It is
      helpful for targets that take a long while.

   -  Record type: choose if this is a bibliographic or an authority target.

   -  XSLT file(s) for transforming results: enter one or more (comma-separated)
      XSLT file names that you want to apply on the search results.

      -  When retrieving records from external targets you may wish to
         automate some changes to those records. XSLT's allow you to do
         this. Koha ships with some sample XSLT files in the
         /koha-tmpl/intranet-tmpl/prog/en/xslt/ directory ready for use:

This section is used to configure SMTP servers to send emails through Koha.

.. Note::

   This section is only available to staff members with the manage\_smtp\_servers
   (or superlibrarian) :ref:`permission <patron-permissions-defined-label>`.

The default STMP configuration is set in the koha-conf.xml file. But this
section allows you to add additional servers.

|smtpservers|

To add a new server,

-  Click 'New SMTP server'

   |newsmtpserver|

   -  Name (required): give the server a significant name, this is the name that
      will be displayed in Koha

   -  Host (required): enter the host name or IP address of the server

   -  Port (required): enter the port number provided by your administrator

   -  Timeout (seconds): enter the number of seconds after which an unsent email
      will result in an error

   -  SSL: choose the security protocol provided by your administrator

      -  Disabled: no security (not recommended)

      -  SSL

      -  STARTTLS

   -  Username: enter the username provided by your administrator

   -  Password: enter the password provided by your administrator

   -  Debug mode: choose whether to enable the debug mode to send additional
      output to the logs

   -  Default server: choose whether this server is the default one to be used
      by all libraries

-  Click 'Submit'

Once the server is added, you can select it in the
:ref:`library's details <adding-a-library-label>`.

.. _did-you-mean?-label:

Did you mean?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Get there:* More > Administration > Additional parameters > Did you
mean?

Koha can offer 'Did you mean?' options on searches based on values in
your :ref:`authorities <authorities-label>`.

    **Important**

    Did you mean? only works in the OPAC at this time. The intranet
    options are here for future development.

Using this page you can control which options Koha gives patrons on
their search results.

|image235|

To turn on the 'Did you mean?' bar on your search results you need to
check the box next to each plugin you would like to use. The two plugins
you have to choose from are:

-  The ExplodedTerms plugin suggests that the user try searching for
   broader/narrower/related terms for a given search (e.g. a user
   searching for "New York (State)" would click the link for narrower
   terms if they're also interested in "New York (City)"). This is only
   relevant for libraries with highly hierarchical authority data.

-  The AuthorityFile plugin searches the authority file and suggests the
   user might be interested in bibs linked to the top 5 authorities

If you want one plugin to take priority over another you simply drag it

Table settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This administration area will help you hide or display columns on fixed
tables throughout the staff interface and OPAC.

-  *Get there:* Administration > Additional parameters > Table settings

|tablesettings|

Clicking on the module you'd like to edit tables for will show you the
options available to you.

This area lets you control the columns that show in the table in
question. If nothing is hidden you will see no check marks in the 'is
hidden by default' column.

|setcurrencynohide|

And will see all of the columns when viewing the table on its regular
page.

|currenciesnohide|

If columns are hidden they will have checks in the 'is hidden by
default' column.

|setcurrencyhide|

And hidden when you view the table.

|currencieshide|

The 'Cannot be toggled' column is used to prevent individual users from showing 
or hiding this column when viewing the table.

Individual users can toggle columns using the 'Columns' button at the
top of the table.

|togglecolumns|

For example, in the Currencies table, the 'Currency' and 'Rate' columns cannot 
be toggled. When the user clicks on the 'Columns' button, they are not able to 
choose whether these two columns are hidden or visible.

Note that using the 'Columns' button show or hide columns will only toggle them 
for the current user and session. Once the user logs out, the columns will go 
back to their default settings as set in the table settings administration 
page. It will not affect any other user.

.. Note::

  Patrons in the OPAC can't toggle column visibility. For OPAC tables
  this feature only allows to control the visibility of columns.

.. Note::

  Any tables with columns listed here also have the option to export to Excel, export to CSV,
  copy, or print within the table header.

.. _audio-alerts-label:

Audio alerts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have your :ref:`AudioAlerts <AudioAlerts-label>` preference set to
'Enable' you will be able to control the various alert sounds that Koha
uses from this area.

-  *Get there:* More > Administration > Additional parameters > Audio
   alerts

Each dialog box in Koha has a CSS class assigned to it that can be used
as a selector for a sound.

    |image1213|

You can edit the defaults by clicking the 'Edit' button to the right of
each alert.

    |image1214|

You can assign alerts to other CSS classes in Koha by entering that
information in the selector box. For example if you enter

::

    body:contains('Check in message')

Then when you visit the check-in page you will hear an alert.

Every page in Koha has a unique ID in the body tag which can be used to
limit a sound to a specific page

Any ID selector (where HTML contains id="name\_of\_id" ) and can also be
a trigger as: #name\_of\_selector

.. _sms-cellular-providers-label:

SMS cellular providers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. Important::

   This option will only appear if the
    :ref:`smssenddriver-label` preference is set to 'Email'.

.. Note::
   Many mobile providers have deprecated support for the SMS::Send::Email feature. It is not recommended for use unless you have a dedicated SMS to Email gateway.

From here you can enter as many cellular providers as you need to send
SMS notices to your patrons using the email protocol.

Share content with Mana KB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mana KB is a worldwide knowledge base used to share content specific to libraries.
Koha is currently connected to Mana Kb in order to share serial subscription
models and reports. This section is used to configure your connexion
with Mana KB.

*Get there:* More > Administration > Additional parameters > Share
content with Mana KB

|image1426|

In the form, choose whether you want to use Mana KB to share content or not.
The default is "No, let me think about it". If you do want to use Mana KB,
change the option to "Yes". If you do not want to share with Mana KB, choose
"No", this will remove the blue rectangle from the Administration home
page.

The rest of this section assumes you chose "Yes".

Choose whether you want to share your subscription models automatically.
This means that every time you create a subscription in the serials
module, it will be automatically shared with Mana KB and other libraries
will be able to copy it.

In order to configure Mana KB, you must get a Mana KB token to authenticate
your Koha installation on the Mana KB server.

Enter your name or your organization's name in the "Your name" field.

Enter your email in the "Email" field. Make sure you have access to this
email inbox since you will receive further information by email.

Once you send your information to Mana KB, you will get a Mana KB token.

In the email your receive, click on the confirmation link and confirm you
are not a robot to finish the Mana KB setup.

   if you need to).

-  MARC field: for additional subscription fields, it is possible to link
   the field to a MARC field. The additional field will be automatically
   populated with the corresponding record's value for this MARC field.

.. Note::

    You can only choose one of the two options (authorized value OR MARC field)

Examples of additional fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Example 1:** Additional subscription field using 
:ref:`authorized values <authorized-values-label>`

You might want to track which department you're ordering this serial for

-  In the 'Name' field, enter 'Department'

-  In the 'Authorized value category' field, choose DEPARTMENT

-  Check the 'Searchable' box

|adddept|

When you are :ref:`adding a subscription <add-a-subscription-label>`,
the field will be in the 'Additional fields' section with its
authorized values drop-down menu.

|addsub2|

When you view the subscription, the field will appear under 'Additional
fields'.

|subscriptiondetails|

Because we made the field searchable, it will also be in the serials
subscription search.

|advancedserialsearch|

**Example 2:** Additional subscription field using MARC field

This is particularly useful if you want to view bibliographic
information in the subscription detail page. In this example, we will
add the 521$a field, which is, in MARC21, the target audience note.

- In the 'Name' field, enter 'Target audience'

- In the 'MARC field' field, enter '521$a'

|addmarcfield|

.. Note::

   You will not be able to edit this field from the subscription
   form. If you need to add or change the value in this field,
   you must go through the :ref:`cataloging module <cataloging-label>`.

When you view the subscription, the field and the information from the
bibliographic record will appear under 'Additional fields'.

|subscriptiondetails|

**Example 3:** Free text invoice additional field

If you need to enter additional information in invoices, such as the number of
the check used to pay for the invoice, you can choose not to use an authorized
value at all.

-  In the 'Name' field, enter 'Check #'

-  Check the 'Searchable' box

|addcheck|

The new fields will be displayed when :ref:`viewing the invoice <invoices-label>`
in the :ref:`acquisitions module <acquisitions-label>`.

|invoice|

Because we made the field searchable, it will also be in the invoice search.

|invoicesearch|
