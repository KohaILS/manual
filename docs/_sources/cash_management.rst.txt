Point of sale
=============

Point of sale is a module designed for selling items to people who are not 
registered at the library or to make sales that do not need to be linked to a 
patron account.

For example, you can sell used books or promotional items. These items can be 
sold to anyone and you don't need to link the sale to a particular patron.

For invoices that need to be linked to a patron's account (like a lost item or 
new card fee), use :ref:`manual invoicing <creating-manual-invoices-label>`.

Once all the items have been added, quantities and prices adjusted if needed,
fill out the 'Collect payment' form.

-  Amount being paid: this is the total, it cannot be edited since it's not
   attached to a patron file, it cannot be partially paid.

-  Amount tendered: enter the actual amount handed to you by the patron. The
   amount tendered must be equal or greater than 'Amoung being paid'.

-  Change to give: if the amount tendered is greater than the amoung being paid,
   Koha will calculate how much change should be returned to the patron.

-  Payment type: choose the type of payment.

   .. Note::

      The values are managed in the
      :ref:`PAYMENT\_TYPE authorized value <existing-values-label>`.

-  Cash register: choose the cash register in which to enter the transaction.

Click 'Confirm' to finalize the sale.

If change was to be given back to the patron, a pop-up window will appear to
remind you, click 'Yes' to confirm that you gave back the correct amount and
confirm the payment.
