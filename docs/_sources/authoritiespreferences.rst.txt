.. _authdisplayhierarchy-label:

AuthDisplayHierarchy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: \_\_\_ broader term/narrower term hierarchies when viewing authorities.

Default: Don't show

Values:

-  Don't show

-  Show

Description:

-  When set to 'Show' broader and narrower 'See also' references will be
   displayed in a tree at the top of the record in both the staff interface
   and the OPAC.

   |AuthDisplayHierarchy|

-  For MARC21, in order for this display to appear, the records must have 5XX
   with the relationship code in $w and the authority number (authid) in $9.

   .. Note::

      The relationship codes in $w can be found on the Library of Congress
      website under `Tracings and references-General information <https://www.loc.gov/marc/authority/adtracing.html>`_

      g - Broader term

      h - Narrower term

   For example, the records in the above screenshot have the following
   information::

     Authority #3
     001  3
     151  $a Germany
     551  $w h
          $a Baden-Württemberg (Germany)
          $9 4

     Authority #4
     001  4
     151  $a Baden-Württemberg (Germany)
     551  $w g
          $a Germany
          $9 3
     551  $w h
          $a Konstanz (Germany)
          $9 5

     Authority #5
     001  5
     151  $a Konstanz (Germany)
     551  $w g
          $a Baden-Württemberg (Germany)
          $9 4

   .. Warning::

     The relationships must be bidirectional, meaning the broader term must
     reference the narrower term and the narrower term must reference the
     broader term.

.. _authoritycontrolledindicators-label:

AuthorityControlledIndicators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: Use the following text to edit how authority records control indicators
of attached biblio fields (and possibly subfield $2). Lines starting with a
comment symbol (#) are skipped. Each line should be of the form: (marc21|unimarc),
tag, ind1:(auth1|auth2|some_value), ind2:(auth1|auth2|thesaurus|some_value).
Here auth1 and auth2 refer to the indicators of the authority record, tag is a
biblio field number or an asterisk (*), and some_value is a fixed value
(one character). The MARC21 option thesaurus refers to indicators controlled by
authority field 008/11 and 040$f.

Description:

-  Used when merging authorities.

-  Controls how the indicators of linked authority records affect the
   corresponding biblio indicators. Currently, the default value is fine-tuned
   for MARC21 and copies the authority indicators for UNIMARC.

-  For example, a MARC21 field 100 in a biblio record should pick its first
   indicator from the linked authority record. The second indicator is not
   controlled by the authority. This report supports such MARC conventions.

.. _authoritymergelimit-label:

AuthorityMergeLimit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: When modifying an authority record, do not update attached bibliographic
records if the number exceeds \_\_\_ records. (Above this limit, the 
:ref:`merge_authority cron job<cron-update-authorities-label>` will update them.)

Default: 50

Description:

-  This system preference determines the maximum number of bibliographic records 
   that can be updated when an authority record changes.

-  This helps prevent overusing resources if an authority record is linked to 
   many bibliographic records.

-  Make sure to enable the :ref:`merge_authority cron job<cron-update-authorities-label>` 
   to catch the updates that wouldn't otherwise be transferred to bibliographic 
   records.

.. _authoritymergemode-label:

AuthorityMergeMode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: loose

Asks: When updating biblio records from an attached authority record ("merging"),
handle subfields of relevant biblio record fields in \_\_\_ mode. In strict mode
subfields that are not found in the authority record, are deleted. Loose mode
will keep them. Loose mode is the historical behavior and still the default.

Values:

-  loose

-  strict

.. _autocreateauthorities-label:

AutoCreateAuthorities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: When editing records, \_\_\_ authority records that are missing.

Default: don't generate

Values:

-  don't generate

-  generate

Description:

-  This system preference allows you to decide if Koha automatically creates
   new authority records from the bibliographic records.

.. Warning::

   :ref:`RequireChoosingExistingAuthority <requirechoosingexistingauthority-label>`
   must be set to "don't require", otherwise this system preference has no
   effect.

-  If this is set to "don't generate", and catalogers enter uncontrolled terms
   in controlled fields, Koha will not generate matching authority records.

-  If set to "generate" (and
   :ref:`RequireChoosingExistingAuthority <requirechoosingexistingauthority-label>`
   is set to "don't require"), Koha will automatically create authority records
   for headings that don't have any authority link when saving a bibliographic
   record.

.. _generateauthorityfield667-label:

GenerateAuthorityField667
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: Use the following text as default value for the 667$a field of MARC21
authority records: \_\_\_

Default: Machine generated authority record

Description:

-  This system preference is used when Koha automatically creates authority
   records when
   :ref:`RequireChoosingExistingAuthority <requirechoosingexistingauthority-label>`
   is set to "don't require" and
   :ref:`AutoCreateAuthorities <AutoCreateAuthorities-label>` is set to
   "generate".

-  Enter the text you want to use in the 667$a field.

.. Note::

   This system preference is only used when :ref:`marcflavour <marcflavour-label>`
   is set to MARC21.

.. _generateauthorityfield670-label:

GenerateAuthorityField670
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: Use the following text as default value for the 670$a field of MARC21
authority records: \_\_\_

Default: Work cat.

Description:

-  This system preference is used when Koha automatically creates authority
   records when
   :ref:`RequireChoosingExistingAuthority <requirechoosingexistingauthority-label>`
   is set to "don't require" and
   :ref:`AutoCreateAuthorities <AutoCreateAuthorities-label>` is set to
   "generate".

-  Enter the text you want to use in the 670$a field.

.. Note::

   This system preference is only used when :ref:`marcflavour <marcflavour-label>`
   is set to MARC21.

.. _marcauthoritycontrolfield008-label:

MARCAuthorityControlField008
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: \|\| aca\|\|aabn \| a\|a d

Asks: Use the following text for the contents of MARC21 authority
control field 008 position 06-39 (fixed length data elements).

    **Important**

    Do not include the date (position 00-05) in this preference, Koha
    will calculate automatically and put that in before the values in
    this preference.

Description:

-  This preference controls the default value in the 008 field on
   Authority records. It does not effect bibliographic records.

.. _requirechoosingexistingauthority-label:

RequireChoosingExistingAuthority
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: When editing records, \_\_\_ catalogers to reference existing authorities.

Default: don't require

Values:

-  don't require

-  require

Description:

-  This system preference determines whether or not catalogers can type into
   authority controlled fields.

-  If set to "don't require", catalogers can manually enter uncontrolled terms
   into controlled fields

-  If set to "require", authority controlled fields will be locked, forcing
   catalogers to search for an authority.

-  If set to "require", it will block
   :ref:`AutoCreateAuthorities <AutoCreateAuthorities-label>`. Authorities will
   have to be catalogued manually (or imported).

.. _unimarcauthorityfield100-label:

UNIMARCAuthorityField100
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: afrey50 ba0

Asks: Use the following text for the contents of UNIMARC authority field
100 position 08-35 (fixed length data elements).

    **Important**

    Do not include the date (position 00-07) in this preference, Koha
    will calculate automatically and put that in before the values in
    this preference.

Description:

-  This preference controls the default value in the 100 field on
   Authority records cataloged in UNIMARC. It does not effect
   bibliographic records.

.. _useauthoritiesfortracings-label:

UseAuthoritiesForTracings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't use

Asks: \_\_\_ authority record numbers instead of text strings for
searches from subject tracings.

Values:

-  Don't use

   -  Search links look for subject/author keywords (example:
      opac-search.pl?q=su:Business%20networks)

-  Use

   -  Search links look for an authority record (example:
      opac-search.pl?q=an:354)

Description:

-  For libraries that have authority files, they may want to make it so
   that when a link to an authorized subject or author is clicked on the
   OPAC or staff client it takes the searcher only to a list of results
   with that authority record. Most libraries do not have complete
   authority files and so setting this preference to 'Don't use' will
   allow searchers to click on links to authors and subject headings and
   perform a keyword search against those fields, finding all possible
   relevant results instead.

.. _linker-label:

Linker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These preferences will control how Koha links bibliographic records to
authority records. All bibliographic records added to Koha after these
preferences are set will link automatically to authority records, for
records added before these preferences are set there is a script
(misc/link\_bibs\_to\_authorities.pl) that your system administrator can
run to link records together.

.. _autolinkbiblios-label:

AutoLinkBiblios
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: \_\_\_ attempt to automatically link headings when saving records in the
cataloging module.

Default: Don't

Values:

-  Do

-  Don't

Description:

-  This system preference determines whether or not Koha will attempt to link
   terms in authority controlled field to existing authority records upon saving
   a new bibliographic record.

-  This system preference is used when creating new bibliographic records.
   :ref:`CatalogModuleRelink <catalogmodulerelink-label>` and
   :ref:`LinkerRelink <linkerrelink-label>` are used when editing bibliographic
   records.

-  If set to "Do", Koha will search in the thesaurus to find a matching
   authority record. If it finds one, it will link it. If it finds more than one,
   :ref:`LinkerModule <linkermodule-label>` will determine which one is linked.

-  If set to "Don't", no linking attempt will be made when saving a new
   bibliographic record.

.. _catalogmodulerelink-label:

CatalogModuleRelink
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: \_\_\_ automatically relink headings that have previously been
linked when saving records in the cataloging module.

Default: Don't

Values:

-  Do

-  Don't

Description:

-  This system preference determines whether or not authority links are checked
   and adjusted when saving a bibliographic record.

-  When set to "Do", Koha will automatically relink headings when a record is
   saved in the cataloging module when :ref:`LinkerRelink <linkerrelink-label>`
   is turned on, even if the headings were manually linked to a different
   authority by the cataloger.

.. Note::

   This system preference requires that :ref:`AutoLinkBiblios <autolinkbiblios-label>`
   be set to "Do".

.. _linkerconsiderthesaurus-label:

LinkerConsiderThesaurus
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: \_\_\_ compare the source for 6XX headings to the thesaurus source for
authority records when linking.

Default: Don't

Values:

-  Don't

-  Do

Description:

-  This system preference is used to enable multiple thesauri support for
   authorities.

   -  The thesaurus used for the term is added to the authority record using
      040$f.

   -  In the bibliographic record, set the second indicator to 7 for 650 and
      add the source to 650$2. For local terms, use 4 (Source not specified) as
      the indicator.

      Example for a bibliographic record::

       650 _ 0 $a Feminism
       650 _ 7 $a Feminism $2 sao
       650 _ 7 $a Feminism $2 barn

      The first example above is the LCSH term. The other two terms are from
      sao (controlled Swedish subject heading system) and barn (Swedish children
      subject heading system). These three are using the same TOPIC_TERM
      Feminism, but they belong to different thesauri.

.. Warning::

   In existing systems, enabling this preference may require a reindex, and may
   generate new authority records if :ref:`AutoCreateAuthorities <autocreateauthorities-label>`
   is enabled.

.. Note::

   Support for multiple authority thesauri currently only works with
   ElasticSearch.

.. _linkerkeepstale-label:

LinkerKeepStale
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Do not

Asks: \_\_\_ keep existing links to authority records for headings where
the linker is unable to find a match.

Values:

-  Do

-  Do not

Description:

-  When set to 'Do', the linker will never remove a link to an authority
   record, though, depending on the value of
   :ref:`LinkerRelink <LinkerRelink-label>`, it may change the link.

.. _linkermodule-label:

LinkerModule
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Default

Asks: Use the \_\_\_ linker module for matching headings to authority
records.

Values:

-  Default

   -  Retains Koha's previous behavior of only creating links when there
      is an exact match to one and only one authority record; if the
      :ref:`LinkerOptions <LinkerOptions-label>` preference is set to
      'broader\_headings', it will try to link headings to authority
      records for broader headings by removing subfields from the end of
      the heading

-  First match

   -  Creates a link to the first authority record that matches a given
      heading, even if there is more than one authority record that
      matches

-  Last match

   -  Creates a link to the last authority record that matches a given
      heading, even if there is more than one record that matches

Description:

-  This preference tells Koha which match to use when searching for
   authority matches when saving a record.

.. _linkeroptions-label:

LinkerOptions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: Set the following options for the authority linker \_\_\_

    **Important**

    This feature is experimental and shouldn't be used in a production
    environment until further expanded upon.

Description:

-  This is a pipe separated (\|) list of options. At the moment, the
   only option available is "broader\_headings." With this option set to
   "broader\_headings", the linker will try to match the following
   heading as follows:

   ::

       =600 10$aCamins-Esakov, Jared$xCoin collections$vCatalogs$vEarly works to 1800.

   First: Camins-Esakov, Jared--Coin collections--Catalogs--Early works
   to 1800

   Next: Camins-Esakov, Jared--Coin collections--Catalogs

   Next: Camins-Esakov, Jared--Coin collections

   Next: Camins-Esakov, Jared (matches! if a previous attempt had
   matched, it would not have tried this)

.. _linkerrelink-label:

LinkerRelink
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Do

Asks: \_\_\_ relink headings that have previously been linked to
authority records.

Values:

-  Do

-  Do not

Description:

-  When set to 'Do', the linker will confirm the links for headings that
   have previously been linked to an authority record when it runs,
   correcting any incorrect links it may find. When set to 'Do not', any
   heading with an existing link will be ignored, even if the existing
   link is invalid or incorrect.
