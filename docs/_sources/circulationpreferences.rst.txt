.. _updateitemlocationoncheckin-label:

UpdateItemLocationOnCheckin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: This is a list of value pairs. The first value is followed immediately
by colon, space, then the second value.

Description:

-  This system preference affects the item's current and permanent locations
   when the item is checked in (whether it was checked out or not).

-  If the location value on the left of the colon (:) matches
   the item's current location, it will be updated to match the location value
   on the right of the colon (:).

-  The values are the LOC :ref:`authorised values <existing-values-label>`.

-  For example, 'STAFF: GEN' will move an item from the staff office to the
   general collection when the item is checked in.

-  Special terms

   -  PROC: Processing center. When using PROC, only the current location will
      be affected.

   -  CART: Shelving cart. When using CART, only the current location will be
      affected.

   -  \_PERM\_: This will use the item's permanent location, whatever that
      location is.

   -  \_BLANK\_: Used on the left as a first value, it will add a location if
       there is none. Used on the right as a second value, it will remove the
       location.

   -  \_ALL\_: Used on the left as a first value, it will affect all items and
      override all other rules.

.. Warning::

   Requires YAML syntax to work

   This means

   -  Make sure there is NO space between the first value and the colon

   -  Make sure there IS a space between the colon and the second value

   -  Make sure each pair is on its own line

-  If using PROC or CART, use the

   hours.

.. _updatenotforloanstatusoncheckin-label:

UpdateNotForLoanStatusOnCheckin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: This is a list of value pairs. When an item is checked in, if the
not for loan value on the left matches the items not for loan value it
will be updated to the right-hand value.

Description:

-  This system preference affects the item's 'not for loan' status
   when the item is checked in (whether it was checked out or not).

-  If the status value on the left of the colon (:) matches
   the item's current status, it will be updated to match the status value
   on the right of the colon (:).

-  The values are the NOT\_LOAN :ref:`authorised values <existing-values-label>`.

-  For example, '-1: 0' will cause an item that was set to 'Ordered' to now be 
   available for loan

-  This system preference can also be used to only display the not for loan
   status. To do so, enter :code:`ONLYMESSAGE` on the right of the colon.
   For example ::

   -1: ONLYMESSAGE

   This will simply show the label for -1 without changing the status.

.. Warning::

   Requires YAML syntax to work

   This means

   -  Make sure there is NO space between the first value and the colon

   -  Make sure there IS a space between the colon and the second value

   -  Make sure each pair is on its own line

.. _checkout-policy-label:

.. _agerestrictionmarker-label:

AgeRestrictionMarker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: Restrict patrons with the following target audience values from
checking out inappropriate materials: \_\_\_

Description:

-  This preference defines certain keywords that will trigger Koha to
   restrict checkout based on age. These restrictions can be overridden
   by the :ref:`AgeRestrictionOverride <AgeRestrictionOverride-label>`
   preference. Enter in this field a series of keywords separated by bar
   (\|) with no spaces. For example PG\|R\|E\|EC\|Age\| will look for PG
   followed by an age number, R folllowed by an age number, Age followed
   by an age number, and so on. These values can appear in any MARC
   field, but Library of Congress recommends the 521$a (Target Audience
   Note). Whatever field you decide to use you must map the word
   agerestriction in the biblioitems table to that field in the :ref:`Koha to
   MARC Mapping <koha-to-marc-mapping-label>`. When cataloging you can enter
   values like PG 13 or E 10 in the 521$a and Koha will then notify
   circulation librarians that the material may not be recommended for
   the patron based on their age.

       **Important**

       You must map the word agerestriction in the biblioitems table to
       the MARC field where this information will appear via the :ref:`Koha

Values:

-  Don't require

-  Require

Description:

-  This preference let's you decide if you want to always be warned that
   the patron has fines when checking out. If you have it set to

   will pop up warning you that the patron owes money.

.. _allowfineoverride-label:

AllowItemsOnHoldCheckoutSCO
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't allow

    **Important**

    This system preference relates only to Koha's web based self checkout.

Description:

-  When this preference is set to 'Allow' patrons will be able to use
   Koha's web based self checkout to check out a book to themselves
   even if it's on hold for someone else. If you would like Koha to
   prevent people from checking out books that are on hold for someone
   else set this preference to "Don't allow".

.. _allowitemsonholdcheckout-label:

AllowItemsOnHoldCheckoutSIP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: \_\_\_ checkouts of items reserved to someone else via SIP checkout 
messages.

Default: Don't allow

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

   check out multiple copies of the same title at the same time. If it's
   set to "Don't allow" then patrons will only be allowed to check out
   one item attached to a record at a time. Regardless of the option
   chosen in this preference records with subscriptions attached will
   allow multiple check outs.

       **Important**

       This will only effect records without a subscription attached.

.. _allownotforloanoverride-label:

AllowNotForLoanOverride
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ staff to override and check out items that are marked as
not for loan.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

-  This parameter is a binary setting which controls the ability of
   staff (patrons will always be prevented from checking these items
   out) to check out items that are marked as "not for loan". Setting it
   to "Allow" would allow such items to be checked out, setting it to
   "Don't allow" would prevent this. This setting determines whether
   items meant to stay in the library, such as reference materials, and
   other library resources can be checked out by patrons.

.. _allowrenewallimitoverride-label:

AllowRenewalLimitOverride
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ staff to manually override the renewal limit and renew a
checkout when it would go over the renewal limit.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

-  This preference is a binary setting which controls the ability of
   staff to override the limits placed on the number of times an item
   can be renewed. Setting it to "Allow" would allow such limits to be
   overridden, setting it to "Don't allow" would prevent this. This is a
   preference in which if it is set to "allow" it would allow the
   library staff to use their judgment for overriding the renew limit
   for special cases, setting it to "Don't allow" prevents an
   opportunity for abuse by the library staff.

.. _allowrenewalonholdoverride-label:

AllowRenewalOnHoldOverride
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: \_\_\_ staff to renew items that are on hold by manually specifying a due date.

Default: Don't allow

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

- This preference enables items that are on hold to be renewed with a due date specified by the user.

  It can appear in two locations:

  1. In the "Checkouts" table on the Patron Details screen. It is possible to select on loan items that would otherwise fulfill a hold request to be renewed. When such an item is selected, an additional date selection box is displayed to allow the user to specify the due date for all on hold items that are to be renewed.

  2. In the Circulation > Renew alert screen. When a barcode of an on loan item that would ordinarily fulfill a hold request is entered, the usual alert is displayed indicating that the item is on hold, it is still possible to override this, and renew. With this preference enabled it is also possible to specify a due date.

.. _allowreturntobranch-label:

AllowReturnToBranch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: to any library

Asks: Allow materials to be returned to \_\_\_

Values:

-  either the library the item is from or the library it was checked out
   from.

Description:

-  This preference lets the library system decide how they will accept
   returns. Some systems allow for items to be returned to any library
   in the system (the default value of this preference) others want to
   limit item returns to only specific branches. This preference will
   allow you to limit item returns (checkins) to the branch(es) set in
   the value.

.. _allowtoomanyoverride-label:

   with an option to checkout more items to a patron than are normally
   allowed in the :ref:`circulation and fines rules <circulation-and-fines-rules-label>`. If
   this preference is set to "Don't allow" then no staff member will be

are returned.

Values:

-  Do

-  Don't

Description:

-  This preference is a binary setting which determines whether an item
   is returned to its home branch automatically or not. If set to
   "Don't", the staff member checking an item in at a location other
   than the item's home branch will be asked whether the item will
   remain at the non-home branch (in which case the new location will be
   marked as a holding location) or returned. Setting it to "Do" will
   ensure that items checked in at a branch other than their home branch
   will be sent to that home branch.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: Charge a lost item to the borrower's account when the LOST value
of the item changes to \_\_\_

Description:

-  Leave this field empty if you don't want to charge the user for lost

   value <#lost>`__ you are using in the
   :ref:`DefaultLongOverdueLostValue <defaultlongoverduelostvalue-and-defaultlongoverduedays-label>`
   preference. This preference is used when the :ref:`longoverdue cron
   job <cron-long-overdues-label>` is called without the --charge parameter.

.. _defaultlongoverduelostvalue-and-defaultlongoverduedays-label:

DefaultLongOverdueLostValue and DefaultLongOverdueDays
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: By default, set the LOST value of an item to \_\_\_ when the item
has been overdue for more than \_\_\_ days.

Description:

-  These preferences are used when the :ref:`longoverdue cron
   job <cron-long-overdues-label>` is called without the --lost parameter. It
   allows users to set the values of the :ref:`longoverdue
   cron <cron-long-overdues-label>` without having to edit the crontab.
   Setting the values to 1 and 30 for example will mark the item with
   the `LOST authorized value <#lost>`__ of 1 after the item is 30 days
   overdue.

.. _homeorholdingbranch-label:

HomeOrHoldingBranch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: the item's home library (homebranch).

Asks: Use the checkout and fines rules of \_\_\_

Values:

-  the item's home library (homebranch).

-  the item's holding library (holdingbranch).

Description:

-  This preference does several things.

   -  If :ref:`CircControl <CircControl-label>` is set to 'the library the item
      is from' then the :ref:`circulation and fines
      policies <circulation-and-fines-rules-label>` will be determined by the item's
      library where HomeOrHoldingBranch chooses if item's home library
      is used or holding library is used.

   -  If :ref:`IndependentBranches <IndependentBranches-label>` is set to
      'Prevent' then the value of this preference is used in figuring
      out if the item can be checked out. If the item's home library
      does not match the logged in library, the item cannot be checked
      out unless you are a :ref:`superlibrarian <patron-permissions-defined-label>`.

    **Important**

    It is not recommend that this setting be changed after initial setup
    of Koha because it will change the behavior of items already checked
    out.

   mark items as 'available' if you choose to 'display a message' or
   'require confirmation.^ If you choose to 'do nothing,^ there will be
   no notification that the item being checked out is marked as 'lost.^

.. _issuinginprocess-label:

IssuingInProcess
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't prevent

Asks: \_\_\_ patrons from checking out an item whose rental charge would
take them over the limit.

Values:

-  Don't prevent

-  Prevent

Description:

-  This preference determines if a patron can check items out if there
   is an overdue fine on the account and any of the materials the patron
   wishes to check out will potentially tip the account balance over the
   maximum fines policy the library has in place.

Example: Your library has a $5 limit set for 'fines' (i.e., after
incurring $5 in fines, a patron can no longer check out items). A patron
comes to the desk with 5 items to check out (4 books and a video) The
patron has $4 in charges already on their account. One of the videos has
a rental charge of $1, therefore making the total fines on the patron's
account suddenly $5 (the limit).

.. _itemsdeniedrenewal-label:

ItemsDeniedRenewal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: Define custom rules to deny specific items from renewal.

Description:

-  This preference allows you to specify items that should not be renewed
   either from the OPAC or staff client.  You can enter any combination of
   fields (from the items table in the Koha database) followed by a colon
   then a space then a bracketed list of values separated by commas. e.g:

   ::

       ccode: [NEWFIC,NULL,DVD]
       itype: [NEWBK,""]

-  The word 'NULL' can be used to block renewal on undefined fields,
   while an empty string "" will block on an empty (but defined) field.

    **Note**

    If using automatic renewal notices your notice text should be updated to
    account for the new reason that renewals may be denied "item_denied_renewal".

-  Ignore the calendar

-  Use the calendar to push the due date to the next open matching weekday
   for weekly loan periods, or the next open day otherwise (Note: This preference
   setting only works with loan periods in multiples of 7).

Description:

-  This preference controls how scheduled library closures affect the
   due date of a material.

-  The 'Use the calendar to skip all days the library is closed' setting allows 
   for a scheduled closure not to count as a day in the loan period. 

-  The 'Ignore the calendar' setting would not consider the scheduled closure 
   at all

-  The 'Use the calendar to push the due date to the next open day' would only 
   affect the due date if the day the item is due would fall specifically on
   the day of closure.

-  The final option, 'Use the calendar to push the due date to the next open 
   matching weekday for weekly loan periods, or the next open day otherwise' 
   allows libraries to accommodate patrons who may only be able to visit the 
   library on a certain day of the week, such as part-time students or patrons 
   who rely on public transport.

Example:

-  The library has put December 24th and 25th in as closures on the
   calendar. A book checked out by a patron has a due date of December
   25th according to the circulation and fine rules.

   -  If this preference is set to 'Ignore the calendar' then the item will 
      remain due on the 25th.

   -  If the preference is set to 'Use the calendar to push the due date to the 
      next open day', then the due date will be December 26th.

   -  If the preference is set to 'Usethe calendar to skip all days the library 
      is closed' then the due date will be pushed to the 27th of December to 
      accommodate for the two closed days.

   -  If the preference is set to 'Use the calendar to push the due date to the 
      next open matching weekday for weekly loan periods, or the next open day 
      otherwise' the item would be due back on January 1st. If January 1st was 
      also a closed day then the item would be due back on the next available 
      open day.

The calendar is defined on a branch by branch basis. To learn more about
the calendar, check out the :ref:`Calendar<calendar-label>`
section of this manual.

between branches.

Values:

-  Don't use

-  Use

Description:

-  If the system is configured to use the :ref:`Transport cost
   matrix <transport-cost-matrix-label>` for filling holds, then when
   attempting to fill a hold, the system will search for the lowest cost
   branch, and attempt to fill the hold with an item from that branch
   first. Branches of equal cost will be selected from randomly. The
   branch or branches of the next highest cost shall be selected from
   only if all the branches in the previous group are unable to fill the
   hold.

   The system will use the item's current holding branch when
   determining whether the item can fulfill a hold using the Transport
   Cost Matrix.

    :ref:`CalculateFinesOnReturn <CalculateFinesOnReturn-label>`

    If the cronjobs/fines.pl cronjob is being run, accruing and final fines will 
    be calculated when the cron runs and accruing fines will be finalized when 
    an item is returned. If CalculateFinesOnReturn is enabled, final fines will 
    be calculated when an item is returned.

the :ref:`NoRefundOnLostReturnedItemsAge <NoRefundOnLostReturnedItemsAge-label>` system preference.

.. _suspensionscalendar-label:

SuspensionsCalendar
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: not including the days the library is closed

Asks: Calculate suspension expiration based on days overdue \_\_\_

Values:

-  Ignore the calendar

-  Use the calendar

Description:

-  This system preference determines whether the :ref:`calendar <calendar-label>` is taken into
   account when making suspension calculations.  Suspension rules can be
   configured within the :ref:`circulation rules <circulation-and-fines-rules-label>`.
   If set to ‘directly’ the suspension period will ignore any closed days
   that have been added to the calendar.  If set to ‘not including the
   days the library is closed’ any days marked as closed within the calendar
   will be skipped when calculating the end date for the suspension.

.. _usedefaultreplacementcost-label:

useDefaultReplacementCost
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't use

Asks: \_\_\_ the default replacement cost defined in item type.

Values:

-  Don't use

-  Use

Description:

-  This preference enables the use of the replacement cost set on the item type level

.. _whenlostchargereplacementfee-label:

WhenLostChargeReplacementFee
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Charge

Asks: \_\_\_ the replacement price when a patron loses an item.

Values:

-  Charge

-  Don't charge

Description:

-  This preference lets you tell Koha what to do with an item is marked
   lost. If you want Koha can 'Charge' the patron the replacement fee
   listed on the item they lost or it can do nothing in reference to the
   patron and just mark the item lost in the catalog.

.. _whenlostforgivefine-label:

WhenLostForgiveFine
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't forgive

Asks: \_\_\_ the fines on an item when it is lost.

Values:

-  Don't forgive

-  Forgive

Description:

-  This preference allows the library to decide if fines are charged in
   addition to the replacement fee when an item is marked as lost. If
   this preference is set to 'Forgive' then the patron won't be charged
   fines in addition to the replacement fee.

.. _holds-policy-label:

Holds policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _allowholddateinfuture-label:

AllowHoldDateInFuture
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ hold requests to be placed that do not enter the waiting
list until a certain future date.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

.. _allowholditemtypeselection-label:

AllowHoldItemTypeSelection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't allow

Asks: \_\_\_ hold fulfillment to be limited by itemtype.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

.. _allowholdpolicyoverride-label:

AllowHoldPolicyOverride
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ staff to override hold policies when placing holds.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

-  This preference is a binary setting which controls whether or not the
   library staff can override the circulation and fines rules as they
   pertain to the placement of holds. Setting this value to "Don't
   allow" will prevent anyone from overriding, setting it to "Allow"
   will allow it. This setting is important because it determines how
   strict the libraries rules for placing holds are. If this is set to
   "Allow", exceptions can be made for patrons who are otherwise
   normally in good standing with the library, but there is opportunity
   for the staff to abuse this function. If it is set to "Don't allow",
   no abuse of the system is possible, but it makes the system entirely
   inflexible in respect to holds.

.. _allowholdsondamageditems-label:

AllowHoldsOnDamagedItems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ hold requests to be placed on damaged items.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

-  This parameter is a binary setting which controls whether or not hold
   requests can be placed on items that are marked as "damaged" (items
   are marked as damaged by editing subfield 4 on the item record).
   Setting this value to "Don't allow" will prevent anyone from placing
   a hold on such items, setting it to "Allow" will allow it. This
   preference is important because it determines whether or not a patron
   can place a request for an item that might be in the process of being
   repaired or not in good condition. The library may wish to set this
   to "Don't allow" if they were concerned about their patrons not
   receiving the item in a timely manner or at all (if it is determined
   that the item is beyond repair). Setting it to "Allow" would allow a
   patron to place a hold on an item and therefore receive it as soon as
   it becomes available.

.. _allowholdsonpatronspossessions-label:

AllowHoldsOnPatronsPossessions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_\_ a patron to place a hold on a record where the patron
already has one or more items attached to that record checked out.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

-  By setting to "Don't allow," you can prevent patrons from placing
   holds on items they already have out, thus preventing them from
   blocking anyone else from getting an item.

.. _allowrenewalifotheritemsavailable-label:

AllowRenewalIfOtherItemsAvailable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't allow

Asks: \_\_\_ a patron to renew an item with unfilled holds if other
available items can fill that hold.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

.. _autoresumesuspendedholds-label:

AutoResumeSuspendedHolds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ suspended holds to be automatically resumed by a set date.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

-  If this preference is set to 'Allow' then all suspended holds will be
   able to have a date at after which they automatically become
   unsuspended. If you have this preference set to 'Allow' you will also
   need the :ref:`Unsuspend Holds <cron-unsuspend-holds-label>` cron job running.

    **Important**

    The holds will become unsuspended the date after that entered by the
    patron.

.. _canmarkholdstopullaslost-label:

CanMarkHoldsToPullAsLost
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: \_\_\_ from the 'Holds to pull' screen

Default: Do not allow to mark items as lost

Values:

-  Allow to mark items as lost

-  Allow to mark items as lost and notify the patron

-  Do not allow to mark items as lot

Description:

-  This preference lets you choose whether the staff can mark items
   as lost directly from the :ref:`'Holds to pull' list <holds-to-pull-label>`
   if they can't find the item on the shelf.

-  The actual lost value that will be assigned to the item is defined in the 
   :ref:`UpdateItemWhenLostFromHoldList <UpdateItemWhenLostFromHoldList-label>`
   system preference.

-  If the patron is notified, the message sent will be based on the
   CANCEL\_HOLD\_ON\_LOST template. It can be customized in the
   :ref:`Notices and slips tool <notices-and-slips-label>`.

.. Warning::

   This only applies to item-level holds.

.. _canreservefromotherbranches-label:

canreservefromotherbranches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ a user from one library to place a hold on an item from
another library

Description:

-  This preference is a binary setting which determines whether patrons
   can place holds on items from other branches. If the preference is
   set to "Allow" patrons can place such holds, if it is set to "Don't
   allow" they cannot. This is an important setting because it
   determines if users can use Koha to request items from another
   branch. If the library is sharing an installation of Koha with other
   independent libraries which do not wish to allow interlibrary
   borrowing it is recommended that this parameter be set to "Don't
   allow".

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow (with :ref:`IndependentBranches <IndependentBranches-label>`)

.. _confirmfutureholds-label:

ConfirmFutureHolds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: 0

Asks: Confirm future hold requests (starting no later than \_\_\_ days
from now) at checkin time.

Description:

-  When confirming a hold at checkin time, the number of days in this
   preference is taken into account when deciding which holds to show
   alerts for. This preference does not interfere with renewing,
   checking out or transferring a book.

    **Note**

    This number of days will be used too in calculating the default end
    date for the Holds to pull-report. But it does not interfere with
    issuing, renewing or transferring books.

    **Important**

    This preference is only looked at if you're allowing hold dates in
    the future with :ref:`AllowHoldDateInFuture <AllowHoldDateInFuture-label>`
    or :ref:`OPACAllowHoldDateInFuture <OPACAllowHoldDateInFuture-label>`

.. _decreaseloanhighholds-preferences-label:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: \_\_\_ the reduction of loan period \_\_\_ to days for high demand items
with more than \_\_\_ holds \_\_\_ . Ignore items with the following statuses
when counting items \_\_\_

-  over the number of holdable items on the records

-  on the record

decreaseLoanHighHoldsIgnoreStatuses

-  [Select All]

-  Damaged

-  Lost

-  Not for loan

-  Withdrawn

Description:

-  These preferences let you change the loan length for items that have
   many holds on them. This will not affect items that are already
   checked out, but items that are checked out after the
   decreaseLoanHighHoldsValue is met will only be checked out for the
   number of days entered in the decreaseLoanHighHoldsDuration
   preference.

   |decreaseLoanHighHoldsDuration|

.. _defaultholdpickuplocation-label:

DefaultHoldPickupLocation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: When placing a hold via the staff interface default the pickup location
to the \_\_\_ .

Values:

-  item's holding library

-  item's home library

-  logged in library

Default: logged in library

Description:

-  This system preference lets you determine which library is the default
   pickup location while
   :ref:`placing holds in the staff interface<placing-holds-in-staff-client-label>`.

.. Warning::

   This system preference only applies to item-level holds.

.. _displaymultiplacehold-label:

search results

Values:

-  Don't enable

.. _emaillibrarianwhenholdisplaced-label:

emailLibrarianWhenHoldIsPlaced
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't enable

Asks: \_\_\_ sending an email to the Koha administrator email address
whenever a hold request is placed.

Values:

-  Don't enable

-  Enable

Description:

-  This preference enables Koha to email the library staff whenever a
   patron requests an item to be held. While this function will
   immediately alert the librarian to the patron's need, it is extremely
   impractical in most library settings. In most libraries the hold
   lists are monitored and maintained from a separate interface. That
   said, many libraries that allow on shelf holds prefer to have this
   preference turned on so that they are alerted to pull an item from
   the shelf.

    **Important**

    In order for this email to send you must have a
    :ref:`notice <notices-and-slips-label>` template with the code of HOLDPLACED

    **Important**

    This notice will only be sent if the :ref:`process\_message\_queue.pl
    cron job <cron-message-queue-label>` is being run periodically to send the
    messages.

.. _enableitemgroupholds-label:

EnableItemGroupHolds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: \_\_\_ the ability to place holds on item groups.

Values:

-  Don't enable

-  Enable

Default: Don't enable

Description:

-  This system preference allows users to place holds on item groups.

-  This is useful if you need to place holds on a subset of items on a
   bibliographic record, rather than a specific item or the next available item.

-  Requires :ref:`EnableItemGroups<enableitemgroups-label>`

.. _enableitemgroups-label:

EnableItemGroups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: \_\_\_ the item groups feature to allow collecting groups of items on a
record together.

Description:

-  This system preference enables the item groups feature.

-  It can be used with :ref:`EnableItemGroupHolds<enableitemgroupholds-label>`
   to allow holds on item groups.

.. _excludeholidaysfrommaxpickupdelay-label:

Asks: \_\_\_ when calculating the period for a hold's max pickup delay.

Default: Ignore the calendar

Values:

-  Ignore the calendar

-  Use the calendar

Description:

-  This system preference determines whether or not closed days in the 
   :ref:`calendar<calendar-label>` are taken into account when calculating the 
   time period for patrons to pick up their holds (see 
   :ref:`ReservesMaxPickUpDelay <ReservesMaxPickUpDelay-label>`).

-  If set to 'Ignore the calendar', the pickup delay will be calculated 
   directly.

-  If set to 'Use the calendar', holidays will be excluded from the pickup 
   delay.

.. _expirereservesmaxpickupdelay-label:

ExpireReservesMaxPickUpDelay
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: \_\_\_ holds to expire automatically if they have not been picked
by within the time period specified in
:ref:`ReservesMaxPickUpDelay <ReservesMaxPickUpDelay-label>`

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

-  If set to 'allow' this will cancel holds that have been waiting for
   longer than the number of days specified in the
   :ref:`ReservesMaxPickUpDelay <ReservesMaxPickUpDelay-label>` system
   preference. Holds will only be cancelled if the :ref:`Expire Holds cron
   job <cron-expired-holds-label>` is running.

.. _expirereservesautofill-label:

ExpireReservesAutoFill
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: \_\_\_ automatically fill the next hold using the item.

Default: Don't

Values:

-  Don't

-  Do

Description:

-  If :ref:`ExpireReservesMaxPickUpDelay <expirereservesmaxpickupdelay-label>`
   is set to 'Allow', you can choose to automatically fill the next hold when
   a hold is cancelled.

-  If this system preference is set to "Don't", the expired hold will be
   cancelled, but the item will not be used to fill the next hold, if there is
   one. Staff must manually
   :ref:`check in the item in order to trigger the next hold <receiving-holds-label>`.

-  If this system preference is set to "Do", the item will be used to fill the
   next hold, if there is one, without manual input from staff members.

   -  If :ref:`they opted to receive 'Hold filled' notices <advance-notices-and-hold-notices-label>`,
      a notification will be sent to the next patron to advise them that they

         The notice sent is based on the HOLD template, which can be customized
         in the :ref:`Notices and slips tool <notices-and-slips-label>`.

    -  A notification will also be sent to the email address in
       :ref:`ExpireReservesAutoFillEmail <expirereservesautofillemail-label>`
       to alert staff that the hold is now waiting for someone else.

       .. Note::

         The notice sent is based on the HOLD\_CHANGED template, which can be
         customized in the :ref:`Notices and slips tool <notices-and-slips-label>`.

.. Warning::

   This system preference will not have any effect unless
   :ref:`ExpireReservesMaxPickUpDelay <expirereservesmaxpickupdelay-label>` is
   set to 'Allow'.

.. _expirereservesautofillemail-label:

ExpireReservesAutoFillEmail
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: Send email notification of the new hold filled with a canceled item to \_\_\_.

Description:

-  If :ref:`ExpireReservesMaxPickUpDelay <expirereservesmaxpickupdelay-label>`
   is set to 'Allow', and :ref:`ExpireReservesAutoFill <expirereservesautofill-label>`
   is set to 'Do', an email will be sent to alert staff that the hold is now
   waiting for someone else.

      The notice sent is based on the HOLD\_CHANGED template, which can be
      customized in the :ref:`Notices and slips tool <notices-and-slips-label>`.

-  If this system preference is empty, the notification will be sent to the
   :ref:`library's <libraries-label>` reply-to address.

   this preference to charge the patron for not picking up their hold.
   If you don't charge patrons for items that aren't picked up you can
   leave this set to the default which is 0. Holds will only be
   cancelled and charged if the :ref:`Expire Holds cron
   job <cron-expired-holds-label>` is running.

.. _expirereservesonholidays-label:

ExpireReservesOnHolidays
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Allow

Asks: If using :ref:`ExpireReservesMaxPickUpDelay <ExpireReservesMaxPickUpDelay-label>`, \_\_\_ expired holds to be canceled on 
days the library is closed per the calendar.

Values:

Asks: In the staff client, split the holds queue into separate tables by \_\_\_

Values:

-  pickup library

-  pickup library and itemtype

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

-  Changing this preference will not prevent staff from being able to
   transfer titles from one library to another to fill a hold, it will
   only prevent patrons from saying they plan on picking a book up at a
   library other than their home library.

-  The list of available pickup locations will include all libraries that
   have 'Pickup location' set to 'Yes' on the library configuration page.

   after the item is checked in. This preference will tell the patron
   that their item is 'Waiting' for them at their library and ready for
   check out.

-  in random order

   -  If StaticHoldsQueueWeight is left at the default Koha will
      randomize all libraries, otherwise it will randomize the libraries
      listed.

-  in that order

   -  If StaticHoldsQueueWeight is left at the default then this will
      use all of your branches in alphabetical order, otherwise it will
      use the branches in the order that you entered them in the
      StaticHoldsQueueWeight preference.

Descriptions:

-  These preferences control how the :ref:`Holds Queue
   report <holds-queue-label>` is generated using :ref:`a cron
   job <cron-holds-queue-report-label>`.

   If you do not want all of your libraries to participate in the
   on-shelf holds fulfillment process, you should list the the libraries
   that \*do\* participate in the process here by inputting all the
   participating library's branchcodes, separated by commas ( e.g.
   "MPL,CPL,SPL,BML" etc. ).

   By default, the holds queue will be generated such that the system
   will first attempt to hold fulfillment using items already at the
   pickup library if possible. If there are no items available at the
   pickup library to fill a hold, build\_holds\_queue.pl will then use
   the list of libraries defined in StaticHoldsQueueWeight. If
   RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight is disabled ( which it is by default ), the
   script will assign fulfillment requests in the order the branches are
   placed in the StaticHoldsQueueWeight system preference.

   For example, if your system has three libraries, of varying sizes (
   small, medium and large ) and you want the burden of holds
   fulfillment to be on larger libraries before smaller libraries, you
   would want StaticHoldsQueueWeight to look something like
   "LRG,MED,SML".

   If you want the burden of holds fulfillment to be spread out equally
   throughout your library system, simply enable
   RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight. When this system preference is enabled,
   the order in which libraries will be requested to fulfill an on-shelf
   hold will be randomized each time the list is regenerated.

    **Important**

    The :ref:`Transport Cost Matrix <transport-cost-matrix-label>` takes
    precedence in controlling where holds are filled from, if the matrix
    is not used then Koha checks the StaticHoldsQueueWeight. To use the
    Transport Cost Matrix simply set your
    :ref:`UseTransportCostMatrix <UseTransportCostMatrix-label>` preference to
    'Use'

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't transfer

Asks: \_\_\_ items when cancelling all waiting holds.

Values:

-  Don't transfer

-  Transfer

Description:

-  When TransferWhenCancelAllWaitingHolds is set to "Don't transfer", no
   branch transfer records are created. Koha will not allow the holds to
   be transferred, because that would orphan the items at the library
   where the holds were awaiting pickup, without any further instruction
   to staff as to what items are at the library or where they need to
   go. When that system preference set to "Transfer", branch transfers
   are created, so the holds may be cancelled.

   value 1 from the :ref:`LOST authorized value list<existing-values-label>`.

-  Examples of keywords:

   -  itemlost: lost status, uses the 
      :ref:`LOST authorized values list<existing-values-label>`

   -  notforloan: not for loan status, uses the 
      :ref:`NOT_LOAN authorized values list<existing-values-label>`

   -  location: location code, uses the 
      :ref:`LOC authorized values list<existing-values-label>`

   -  ccode: collection code, uses the 
      :ref:`CCODE authorized values list<existing-values-label>`

-  This preference requires that the :ref:`CanMarkHoldsToPullAsLost <CanMarkHoldsToPullAsLost-label>` system
   preference be set to either 'Allow' option

   need for the librarian to click the print button to generate a
   checkout receipt for the patron they're checking out to. If the
   preference is set to clear the screen then "checking out" an empty
   barcode will clear the screen of the patron you were last working
   with.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't require

Asks: \_\_\_ staff to choose which checkouts to show before running the
overdues report.

Description:

-  Koha's overdue report shows you all of the overdue items in your
   library system. If you have a large library system you'll want to set
   this preference to 'Require' to force those running the report to
   first limit the data generated to a branch, date range, patron
   category or other such filter. Requiring that the report be filtered
   before it's run prevents your staff from running a system heavy
   report and slowing down other operations in the system.

-  Do not

Description:

-  Koha can track the number of times and item is checked out and store
   that on the item record in the database. This information is not
   stored by default. Setting this preference to 'Do' will tell Koha to
   track that info every time the item is checked out in real time.
   Otherwise you could use the :ref:`cron job <cron-track-total-checkouts-label>` to have
   Koha update that field nightly.

.. _sip2sortbinmapping-label:

SIP2SortBinMapping
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: Use the following mappings to determine the sort_bin of a returned item.

Description:

-  This system preference is used to set the 'sort bin' or CL response for SIP
   equipment when checking in an item. The mappings entered here will determine which bin the SIP sorter sends an item to.

-  This system preference must be filled with a specific syntax.

   -  Each mapping should be on its own line.

   -  Each mapping should be of the form

      ::

       branchcode:item field:comparator:item field value:sort bin number

      where

      -  'branchcode' is the library where the checkin is being performed (i.e.
         library assigned to the SIP user)

      -  'item field' is a database column in the items table

      -  'comparator' is the type of comparison, possible values are:

        -  :code:`eq` (is equal to)

        -  :code:`<` (is less than)

        -  :code:`<=` (is less than or equal to)

        -  :code:`>` (is greater than)

        -  :code:`>=` (is greater than or equal to)

        -  :code:`ne` (is not equal to)

      - 'item field value' is the value to compare against the value in the
        specified 'item field'

        .. Note::

           Specifying 'item field value' with a leading :code:`\$` and an item field
           name will use the value of that field in the item for comparison.

           For example, :code:`\$holdingbranch` will compare the item field to the item's
           homebranch.

      - 'sort bin number' is the expected return value in the CL field of the
        SIP response for an item matching the rule.

.. Tip::

   The mappings will be taken into account in the order the lines are written, starting with the top one.
   Think carefully about the logic your mappings should follow and which order to write them in to achieve what you want.

Mapping examples
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

   ::

    CPL:itype:eq:BOOK:1

   This will return sort bin 1 for an item of itemtype code 'BOOK' returned to the library with branchcode 'CPL'.

   ::

    CPL:itemcallnumber:<:339.6:3

   This will return sort bin 3 for an item with a callnumber less than 339.6
   returned to the 'CPL' library.

   ::

    CPL:homebranch:ne:\$holdingbranch:X

   This will return sort bin 'X' for an item returned to CPL where the
   holdingbranch is not equal to the homebranch (i.e. any item belonging to a
   different library than 'CPL').

.. Admonition:: Version

   Before Koha version 23.11, each line can only have one 'item field' mapping. From 23.11, each line can use multiple item fields mappings.

   There is no limit on the number of item field mappings that can be used in one line.

   This allows for more refined sorting rules. For example, instead of only sorting by item type, a library may now sort by item type and collection code and not for loan status. 


   ::

    CPL:itype:eq:BOOK:ccode:eq:TEEN:5

   This will return sort bin 5 for an item with the itemtype code 'BOOK' and the collection code 'TEEN' returned to the library with branchcode 'CPL'.

Use case
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Centerville Library (branchcode 'CPL') has SIP equipment which sorts returned items into 4 bins.

-  Bin number 1 is for CPL items to be shelved on floor 1 (items whose location code is 'FLOOR1').

-  Bin 2 is for CPL items to be shelved on floor 2 (items whose location code is 'FLOOR2').

-  Bin 3 is for CPL items that require specific attention, e.g. they need to be checked before shelving or they are part of a specific collection. The CPL stock team is currently recalling the floor 1 Parent collection using this bin.

-  Bin 4 is solely for items that need to be transferred to other libraries (items whose homebranch is not CPL).

Here is the content of their SIP2SortBinMapping system preference.

   ::
      # Items to be transferred go to bin 4
      CPL:homebranch:ne:$holdingbranch:4
      # CPL toys, special stock and Floor 1 parent collection go to bin 3
      CPL:itype:eq:TOY:3
      CPL:notforloan:>=:1:3
      CPL:location:eq:FLOOR1:ccode:eq:PARENT:3
      # Other floor 1 CPL stock to bin 1
      CPL:location:eq:FLOOR1:1
      # Floor 2 CPL stock to bin 2
      CPL:location:eq:FLOOR2:2

Note that the mapping for bin 4 is at the top.
This ensures that items to be transferred to other libraries are dealt with first; the next mappings will therefore only concern CPL items.

.. _uselocationasaqisip-label:

UseLocationAsAQInSIP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: Use \_\_\_ for AQ field in SIP protocol.

Default: homebranch

Values:

-  homebranch

-  permanent\_location

Description:

-  This system preference allows you to decide which item information is used
   as the AQ response for SIP equipment.

-  AQ is used in automated sorting bins, for example, as the item's 'permanent
   location'. For some libraries, that might mean the item's home library,
   whereas for others it might mean the item's permanent location.
