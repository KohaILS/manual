Patron clubs create clubs in which patrons may be enrolled. It is
useful for tracking summer reading programs, book clubs and other such clubs.

    **Important**

    Staff will need the :ref:`clubs permissions <patron-permissions-defined-label>`
    to edit clubs, templates and enroll patrons. To learn how to set patron
    permissions, go to the :ref:`patron permissions section <setting-patron-permissions-label>`
    of this manual.

Creating a new club template
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Click on the 'New club template' button. Here you can add fields that can be
filled out at the time a new club is created based on the template, or a new
enrollment is created for a given club based on the template.

The name is required. This could be something like 'Adult book club', 'Childrenâ€™s
book club' or 'Summer reading program'. Remember these templates will be starting
point for each club you create.

The description can be any additional information.

Allow public enrollment: if this box is checked it will allow patrons to enroll
in a club based on this template from the OPAC.

Require valid email address: if this box is checked only patrons
with a valid email address can enroll. So they will need a email address
to enroll.

branches create clubs with this template. If you let it set to blank, staff
from any branch will be able to create a new club using this template.

Club fields: these fields will be used when creating a club based on this
template. For example, this can be the name of the club, the name of the animator, the theme, etc.

.. _comments-label:

Comments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Patrons and circulation > Comments

All comments added by patrons via the OPAC to bibliographic records
require moderation by the librarians. If there are comments awaiting

|commentapproved|

.. _patron-import-label:

Patron import
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Patrons and circulation > Import patrons

The patron import tool can be used at any time to add patrons in bulk.
It is commonly used in universities and schools when a new batch of
students registers.

.. _creating-patron-file-label:

Creating a patron import file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can download a blank CSV file with a header from the start page
of the patron import tool that you can use as a template for your
patron import. The header contains all fields that can be used with
the patron import tool. You can delete fields and columns you don't need
with the exception of a few mandatory ones. When overlaying, if your new .csv 
includes blank columns, any existing values in patron records will be overwritten 
with blanks. It is best to remove any blank columns in a .csv to ensure no existing data
is removed.

 **Important**

    cardnumber, surname, and all fields you have
    defined in the :ref:`BorrowerMandatoryField <borrowermandatoryfield-label>`
    preference are required and must match valid entries in your
    database.

    **Important**

    The 'password' should be stored in plaintext, and will be converted
    to a Bcrypt hash.

    If your passwords are already encrypted, talk to your systems
    administrator about options

    **Important**

    Date formats should match your :ref:`dateformat system preference <dateformat-label>`,
    and must be zero-padded, e.g. '01/02/2008'. Alternatively you can supply
    dates in ISO format (e.g. '2008-12-01').

    **Important**

    If your data contains special characters or diacritics, make sure your file
    is encoded in UTF-8. Otherwise, the special characters will not be imported
    correctly.

    **Note**

    If loading :ref:`patron attributes <patron-attribute-types-label>`, the
    'patron\_attributes' field should contain a comma-separated list of
    attribute types and values.

    -  The attribute type code and a colon should precede each value.

       -  For example: "INSTID:12345,BASEBALL:Cubs"

       -  This field must be wrapped in quotes if multiple values are
          defined.

       -  Since values can contain spaces, additional doubled-quotes may
          be required:

          -  "INSTID:12345,BASEBALL:Cubs,""BASEBALL:White Sox""

    **Note**

    It's possible to set restrictions using the patron import
    tool. If the expiration date and comment match an existing restriction,
    the one in the import file will be skipped. So a patron import can be
    repeated multiple times without creating duplicate restrictions.
    But if one of the criteria is different, a new restriction will be added.

.. _importing-patrons-label:

Importing patrons
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have created your file, you can use the patron import tool to
bring the data into Koha.

-  Choose your CSV file

   |image255|

-  Choose to match on 'cardnumber' or 'username' to prevent adding of
   duplicate card numbers to the system. Additional matchpoints can be
   set up using patron attributes marked as unique.

   |image256|

-  Next you can choose default values to apply to all patrons you are
   importing

   -  For example, if you're importing patrons specific to one branch you can use
      the field on the import form to apply the branch code to all those
      you are importing.

-  Finally, you need to decide on what data you want to replace if there
   are duplicates.

   -  A matching record is found using the field you chose for matching
      criteria to prevent duplication

     |image257|

   -  When using patron attributes in your installation, you can choose how
      they are handled on import. You can either decide to always overlay all
      patron attributes or you choose to only replace patron attributes
      included in your import file. This will leave other attributes
      untouched.

     |image1355|

.. _notices-and-slips-label:

Notices & slips
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Patrons and circulation > Notices & slips

All notices and circulation receipts (or slips) generated by Koha can be
customized using the Notices & slips tool. The system comes with several
predefined templates that will appear when you first visit this tool.

|image258|

     **Note**

     -  You can customize the columns of this table in the 
        :ref:`'Table settings'<column-settings-label>` section of the 
        Administration module (table id: lettert).

Each notice can be edited, but only a few can be deleted, this is to
prevent system errors should a message try to send without a template.
Each notice and slip can be edited on a per library basis, by default
you will see the notices for all libraries.

If you have a style you'd like applied to all slips you can point the
:ref:`SlipCSS <slipcss-label>` preference to a stylesheet. The same is true for
notices, using the :ref:`NoticeCSS <noticecss-label>` preference to define a
stylesheet.

You will also want to review the `Customising notices and slips
<https://wiki.koha-community.org/wiki/Customising_Notices_and_Slips>`_
wiki page for more information on formatting these notices.

.. _adding-notices-and-slips-label:

Adding notices and slips

   -  **Note**

          With overdue notices, be sure to put your branch name in the
          description as well so that it will be visible when setting up
          your :ref:`triggers <overdue-notice/status-triggers-label>`.

-  Next you can customize the notice for every possible delivery method

   -  Every notice should have an Email template set for it

      |image1220|

   -  If you're using the
      :ref:`TalkingTechItivaPhoneNotification <talkingtechitivaphonenotification-label>`
      service you can set up a Phone notification

   -  If you have enabled SMS notices with the
      :ref:`SMSSendDriver <smssenddriver-label>` preference you can set the text
      for your SMS notices next

      |image1223|

-  Each notice offers you the same options

   -  If you plan on writing the notice or slip in HTML check the 'HTML
      message' box, otherwise the content will be generated as plain
      text

   -  Message subject is what will appear in the subject line of the
      email

   -  In the message body feel free to type whatever message you feel is
      best, use the fields on the left hand side to enter individualized
      data from the from database.

      -  **Note**

             Review the `Customising notices and slips <https://wiki.koha-community.org/wiki/Customising_Notices_and_Slips>`_
             wiki page for more information.

      -  **Important**

             Overdue notices can use <<items.content>> tags by
             themselves, or use <item></item> to span all of the tags.
             Learn more about the :ref:`Overdue notice
             markup <overdue-notice-markup-label>`

             -  On overdue notices make sure to use <<items.content>>
                tags to print out the data related to all items that are
                overdue.

             -  The other option, only for overdue notices, is to use
                the <item></item> tags to span the line so that it will
                print out multiple lines. One example for the
                <item></item> tag option is:

                <item>"<<biblio.title>>" by <<biblio.author>>,
                <<items.itemcallnumber>>, Barcode: <<items.barcode>> ,
                Checkout date: <<issues.issuedate>>, Due date:
                <<issues.date\_due>> Fine: <<items.fine>> </item>

      -  **Important**

             Only the overdue notices take advantage of the
             <item></item> tags, all other notices referencing items
             need to use <<items.content>>

      -  **Note**

             To add today's date you can use the <<today>> syntax

      -  **Note**

             If you don't want to print the patron's full name on your
             slips or notice you can enter data in the Other name or
             Initials field for each patron and use that value instead.

   -  The system preference :ref:`TranslateNotices <translatenotices-label>` will add tabs for each
      installed language to the notices editor. The notice defined in the
      'Default' tab will be used if there is no preferred language set
      for a patron.

      |image1335|

.. _preview-notice-templates-label:

Preview notice templates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For some notices it is possible to preview the notice template showing how
it would look to a specified patron for a particular item or record.

If a notice template is previewable the notice template header will contain a
field to enter preview data

|image1342|

Fill in the necessary information for the template then click the Preview button
below the message body. The preview dialog will indicate if there are any problems
generating the notice template preview.

.. _overdue-notice-markup-label:

Overdue notice markup
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

When creating your overdue notices there are two tags in addition to the
various database fields that you can use in your notices. You will also
want to review the `Customising notices and slips
<https://wiki.koha-community.org/wiki/Customising_Notices_and_Slips>`_
wiki page for information on formatting item information in these notices.

    **Important**

    These new tags only work on the overdue notices, not other
    circulation related notices at this time.

These tags are <item> and </item> which should enclose all fields from
the biblio, biblioitems, and items tables.

An example of using these tags in a notice template might be like:

::

       The following item(s) is/are currently overdue:

       <item>"<<biblio.title>>" by <<biblio.author>>, <<items.itemcallnumber>>, Barcode: <<items.barcode>> Fine: <<items.fine>></item>

Which, assuming two items were overdue, would result in a notice like:

::

       The following item(s) is/are currently overdue:

       "A Short History of Western Civilization" by Harrison, John B, 909.09821 H2451, Barcode: 08030003 Fine: 3.50
       "History of Western Civilization" by Hayes, Carlton Joseph Huntley, 909.09821 H3261 v.1, Barcode: 08030004 Fine: 3.50

      :ref:`patron's account <fines-label>`.

      .. Note::

         The information available to this customization come from the checkouts
         (issues), items and patrons (borrowers).

.. _overdue-notice/status-triggers-label:

Overdue notice/status triggers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Patrons and circulation > Overdue
   notice/status triggers

In order to send the overdue notices that you defined using the
:ref:`Notices & slips <notices-and-slips-label>` tool, you need to first set the triggers to have
these messages.

    **Important**

    In order to have overdue notices sent to your patrons, you need to
    :ref:`set that patron category <adding-a-patron-category-label>` to require overdue
    notices.

    **Important**

    Depending on the value of your
    :ref:`OverdueNoticeCalendar <overduenoticecalendar-label>` preference the
    delay may or may not include days the library is closed based on the
    :ref:`holiday calendar <calendar-label>`.

The Overdue notice/status triggers tool gives the librarian the power to
send up to three notices to each patron type notifying them of overdue
items

|image260|

-  Delay is the number of days after an issue is due before an action is
   triggered.

   -  **Important**

          If you want Koha to trigger an action (send a letter or
          restrict member), a delay value is required.

-  To send additional notices, click on the tabs for 'Second' and
   'Third' notice

-  If you would like to prevent a patron from checking items out because
   of their overdue items, check the 'Restrict' box, this will put a
   notice on the patron's record at checkout informing the librarian
   that the patron cannot check out due to overdue items.

   -  If you choose to restrict a patron in this way you can also have
      Koha automatically remove that restriction with the
      :ref:`AutoRemoveOverduesRestrictions <autoremoveoverduesrestrictions-label>`
      preference.

-  Next you can choose the delivery method for the overdue notice. You
   can choose from Email, Phone (if you are using the :ref:`i-tiva Talking
   Tech service <talkingtechitivaphonenotification-label>`), Print and SMS
   (if you have set your :ref:`SMSSendDriver <smssenddriver-label>`).

.. _patron-card-layouts-label:

Layouts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Patron card creator > Manage > Layouts

A layout defines the text and images that will be printed on to the card
and where it will appear.

    **Note**

    Up to three lines of text, the patron's number in barcode
    representation and up to two images can be printed on to the card.

.. _patron-add-a-layout-label:

Add a layout
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

If you have no layouts defined, you will add a new layout by clicking
the 'New' button and choosing 'Layout'.

|image1224|

You may also choose to press 'Manage layout' on the left side. Here you
are offered a list of available layouts you can select for editing. But
at the top of the page there is still the 'New layout' button.

|image261|

-  The name you assign to the layout is for your benefit, name it
   something that will be easy to identify at a later date

-  The Units pull down is used to define what measurement scale you're
   going to be using for your layout.

   |units|

   -  **Note**

          A Postscript Point is 1/72", an Adobe Agate is 1/64", an Inch
          is 25.4 SI Millimeters

-  Next, note if this layout is for the front or the back of the patron
   card

   -  **Note**

          You will need a layout for both the front and back of your
          card if you have 2-sided library cards, this option doesn't
          allow you to print two sided cards, just lets you track which
          side of the card you're designing.

-  You have the option of adding up to 3 lines of text to your card.
   Your text can be static text of your choosing and/or fields from the
   patron record. If you want to print fields from the patron record you
   want to put the field names in brackets like so - <firstname>

   -  **Note**

          A full list of field names can be found in the database schema
          at http://schema.koha-community.org

-  For each line of text, you can choose your font, font size and the
   location of the text on the card using the lower X and Y coordinates

-  In order to show the barcode and the patron card number you will need
   to check the 'Print card number as barcode' option. This will turn
   the patron card number into a barcode. If you want the number to
   print in human readable format you will need to check the 'Print card
   number as text under barcode' option.

-  Finally you can choose up to two images to print on the card.

   -  One can be the :ref:`patron image <upload-patron-images-label>` which you
      can resize to meet your needs.

   -  The other image can be something like a library logo or symbol
      that you uploaded using the ':ref:`manage
      images <manage-images-label>`' module of the patron card creator
      Tool.

    **Important**

    It is the designers responsibility to define textlines, barcode and
    images such that overlap is avoided.

After saving, your layouts will appear on the 'Manage layouts' page.

.. _patron-templates-label:

Templates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Patron card creator > Manage > Card
   templates

A template describes the arrangement of labels on the label sheet/card
stock you are using. This might be Avery 5160 for address labels,
Gaylord 47-284 for spine labels or Avery 28371 for your patron cards,
just to give a couple of examples. All of the information you will need
for setting up a template may be on the packaging, and if not it can
usually be found on the vendor's website or can be measured from a
sample sheet.

.. _patron-add-a-template-label:

Add a template
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

To add a new template click on the 'New template' button at the top of
your page which brings you to the Edit template form immediately. You
may also choose to press 'Manage templates' on the left side. Here you
are offered a list of available templates you can select for editing.
But in the top of the page there is still the 'New template' button.

|newcardtemplate|

Using the form that appears after pressing either 'Edit' or 'New
template' you can define the template for your sheet of labels or cards.

|image265|

-  Template ID is simply a system generated unique id

-  Template code should be the name of this template to identify it on a
   list of templates

-  You can use the template description to add additional information
   about the template

-  The Units pull down is used to define what measurement scale you're
   going to be using for the template.

   |units|

   -  **Note**

          A Postscript Point is 1/72", an Adobe Agate is 1/64", an Inch
          is 25.4 SI Millimeters

-  The measurements (page height, page width, card width, card height)
   may be on the packaging, and if not it can usually be found on the
   vendor's website or can be measured from a sample sheet.

-  A profile is a set of "adjustments" applied to a given template just
   prior to printing which compensates for anomalies unique and peculiar
   to a given printer (to which the profile is assigned).

   -  Before defining a profile try printing some sample cards so that
      you can take measurements to define a profile to perform the right
      adjustments for your printer/template combination.

   -  After finding and documenting any anomalies in the printed
      document, then you can :ref:`create a profile <patron-add-a-profile-label>` and
      assign it to the template.

   -  **Important**

          Do not specify a profile unless needed, i.e. do not click to
          define a printer profile. It is not possible to remove a
          profile from a template but you can switch to another profile.

   -  **Note**

          If you are using different printers you may be required to
          define several templates that are identical only different
          profiles are specified.

After saving, your templates will appear on the 'Manage templates' page.

|image267|

.. _patron-profiles-label:

Profiles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Patron card creator > Manage > Profiles

A profile is a set of "adjustments" applied to a given
:ref:`template <patron-templates-label>` just prior to printing which compensates
for anomalies unique and peculiar to a given printer. This means if you
set a template up and then print a sample set of data and find that the
items are not all aligned the same on each card, you need to set up a
profile for each printer (or even different tray selections on the same
printer) to make up for the differences in printing styles, such as the
shifting of text to the left, right, top or bottom.

If your cards are printing just the way you want, you will not need a
profile.

.. _patron-add-a-profile-label:

Add a profile
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

To add a new profile, you want to click on the 'Profiles' button at the
top of your page and choose 'New profile'

|image268|

To add a new profile, you want to click on the 'New profile' button at
the top of your page. Using the form that appears you can define the
values to correct the card misalignment on your label sheet. You may
also choose 'Manage profiles' on the left side and select one of the
currently available profiles for editing.

|image269|

-  The Printer name and Paper bin do not have to match your printer
   exactly, they are for your reference so you can remember what printer
   you have set the profile for.

   -  **Note**

          For example: if you want to use the Printer model number in
          printer name you can, or you can call it 'the printer on my
          desk'

-  Template will be filled in once you have chosen which template to
   apply the profile to on the :ref:`template edit form <patron-add-a-template-label>`

-  The Units pull down is used to define what measurement scale you're
   going to be using for your profile.

   |units|

   -  **Note**

          A Postscript Point is 1/72", an Adobe Agate is 1/64", an Inch
          is 25.4 SI Millimeters

-  Offset should be used when the entire image is off center either
   vertically or horizontally. Creep describes a condition where the
   distance between the labels changes across the page or up and down
   the page

   -  For offset and creep values, negative numbers move the printed
      information up and to the left on the printed sheet and positive
      numbers move down and to the right

   -  Example: the text is printed 0 .25" from the left edge of the
      first label, 0 .28" from the left edge of the second label and 0
      .31" from the left edge of the third label. This means the
      horizontal creep should be set to (minus) -0.03 " to make up for
      this difference.

After saving, your profiles will appear on the 'Manage printer profiles'
page.

|image271|

Once you have saved your new profile, you can return to the list of
templates and choose to edit the template that this profile is for.

.. _rotating-collections-label:

Rotating collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Catalog > Rotating collections

Rotating collections is a tool for managing collections of materials
that frequently get shifted from library to library. It adds the ability
to store not only an item's home library and current location but also
information about where it is supposed to be transferred to next to
ensure that all items in the collection are sent to the correct library.
When an item in a rotating collection is checked in, library staff is
notified that the item is part of a rotating collection and which branch
it should be sent to if it is not at the correct one.

    **Important**

    The :ref:`AutomaticItemReturn <automaticitemreturn-label>` system preference
    must be set to "Don't automatically transfer items to their home
    library when they are returned" for rotating collections to function
    properly.

-  To create a new rotating collection, click the "New collection"
   button, fill in the title and description, and click "Submit". Once
   submitted you'll see "Collection name added successfully"; click
   "Return to rotating collections home" to return to the main Rotating
   collections management page (or click Rotating collections in the
   sidebar).

-  To add items to a collection, click "Actions" and choose "Add or
   remove items" next to the collection's name in the list of
   collections. Under "Add or remove items" scan or type in the barcode
   of the item you wish to add to the collection, and hit enter or click
   'Submit' if necessary.

-  To remove an item from a collection, either click 'Remove' next to the
   item's barcode in the list of items within the collection or check
   the "Remove item from collection" box next to the Barcode text box
   under "Add or remove items", and scan or type in the barcode, clicking
   "Submit" or hitting Enter if necessary. Note: The "Remove item from
   collection" checkbox will remain checked as long as you are on the
   "Add or remove items" page, unless you uncheck it, to facilitate
   quickly removing a number of items at a time by scanning their
   barcodes.

.. _transfer-a-rotating-collection-label:

Transfer a rotating collection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Transferring a collection will:

-  Change the current location of the items in that collection to the
   library it is to be transferred to

-  Initiate a transfer from its original current location/holding
   library to the current location/holding library it is to be rotated
   to. When a library receives a collection they will need to check in
   the items to complete the transfer.

You can transfer a collection in one of two ways:

-  From the main Rotating collections page, click on "Actions" and choose
   "Transfer" next to the title of the collection you wish to transfer;
   choose the library you wish to transfer the collection to and click "Transfer
   collection".

-  Or, from the "add or remove items" page for a collection, you can
   click the "Transfer" button, choose the library you wish to transfer
   the collection to and click "Transfer Collection".

    **Important**

    In order to complete the transfer process, the library receiving the
    rotating collection should check in all items from the collection as
    they receive them. This will clear the transfer so that the items
    are no longer shown as being "in transit".

If an item in a rotating collection is checked in at a library other
than the one it is supposed to be transferred to, a notification will
appear notifying library staff that the item is part of a rotating
collection, also letting them know where the item needs to be sent.

   -  Next you can choose if this event is a one time event or if it is
      repeatable.

      -  'Holiday only on this day': this is a one day holiday 

      -  'Holiday repeated every same day of the week': this is a weekly 
         closing (if you're closed every Sunday, for example)

      -  'Holiday repeated yearly on the same date': this is an annual 
         holiday closing (if you're closed on January 1st each year, for 
         example) 

      -  'Holiday on a range': this is a holiday that extends on several 
         days

            **Note**

            Make sure to enter a 'To Date' at the top if you choose 
            'Holiday on a range'

      -  'Holiday repeated yearly on a range': this is a holiday that extends 
         on several days each year (such as summer holidays for schools) 

            **Note**

            Make sure to enter a 'To Date' at the top if you choose 'Holiday 
            repeated yearly on a range'

   -  Finally decide if this event should be applied to all libraries or
      just the one you have originally selected

      -  If you'd rather enter all the holidays and then copy them all
         to another branch all at once you can use the copy menu below
         the calendar

         |image371|

-  After saving you will see the event listed in the summary to the
   right the calendar

Editing events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To edit events

-  Click on the event on the calendar that you want to change (do this
   by clicking on the date on the calendar, not the event listed in the
   summary)

   |image373|

-  From this form you can make edits to the holiday or delete the
   holiday completely.

   -  All actions require that you click 'Save' before the change will
      be made.

-  Clicking on repeatable events will offer slightly different options

   |image374|

   -  In the form above you will note that there is now an option to
      'Generate an exception for this repeated holiday' and 'Generate exceptions 
      on a range of dates' choosing one of these options will allow you to 
      make it so that this date is not closed even though the library is 
      usually closed on this date.

   -  All actions require that you click 'Save' before the change
      will be made.

CSV profiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Additional tools > CSV profiles

CSV profiles are created to define how you would like your cart or list
to export.

.. _add-csv-profiles-label:

Add CSV profiles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To add a CSV profile

-  Click on 'New CSV profile'

   |image376|

   -  The 'Profile name' will appear on the export pull down list when
      choosing 'Download' from your cart or list

      |image378|

   -  The 'Profile type' determines what type of fields you plan to use
      (MARC or SQL) to define your profile

      -  If you choose MARC then you will need to enter MARC fields

         |image1502|

      -  If you choose SQL then you will need to enter SQL database fields

         |image377|

   -  The 'Usage' field is used to indicate what type of report this CSV 
      profile is used with

      -  'Export records' (only available with MARC profile type): this is 
         used to export records from your cart or lists

      -  'Late serial issues claims' (only available with SQL profile type):
         this is used to :ref:`export late issues of serial subscriptions <claim-late-serials-label>`

      -  'Export late orders' (only available with SQL profile type): this is 
         used to :ref:`export late orders in the acquisitions module 
         <claims-and-late-orders-label>`

      -  'Basket export in acquisition' (only available with SQL profile 
          type): this is used to :ref:`download records from acquisitions 
          baskets <create-a-basket-label>`

      -  'Export lost items in report' (only available with SQL profile 
          type): this is used to export a CSV from the :ref:`lost items 
          report <lost-items-label>`

   -  The 'Profile description' is for your own benefit, but will also
      appear in the OPAC when patrons download content, so make sure
      it's clear for your patrons as well

   -  The 'CSV separator' is the character used to separate values and
      value groups

          **Note**

          The most common option here is comma because most spreadsheet
          applications know how to open files split by commas.

   -  The 'Field separator' is the character used to separate duplicate
      fields

      -  Example: You may have multiple 650 fields and this is the
         character that will appear in between each one in the column

         |image379|

   -  The 'Subfield separator' is the character used to separate
      duplicate subfields

      -  Example: You may have multiple $a subfields in a field

   -  The 'Encoding' field lets you define the encoding used when saving
      the file

   -  The 'Only available on the staff interface' checkbox (only for MARC 
      profile types) lets you limit this CSV profile to staff interface 
      only, meaning patrons will not be able to use this profile to export 
      their cart or lists from the OPAC

   -  Finally format your CSV file using the 'Profile MARC fields' or 'Profile
      SQL fields' box

      -  Define which fields or subfields you want to export, separated
         by pipes. Example : 200\|210$a\|301 for MARC or
         biblio.title\|biblio.author for SQL

      -  **Note**

             You can also use your own headers (instead of the ones from
             Koha) by prefixing the field number with a header,
             followed by the equal sign. Example: Personal
             name=100\|title=245$a\|300

When you have entered in all of the information for your profile,
simply click 'Submit' and you will be presented with a confirmation
that your profile has been saved.

Pages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Additional tools > Pages

The pages tool is a tool to create custom additional pages in the OPAC and in 
the staff interface. It is based on the same tool as the 
:ref:`news <news-label>` and the 
:ref:`HTML customizations<html-customizations-label>`, therefore it works in the 
same way.

|pages|

To add a new page:

-  Click 'New entry'

   |addpage|

   -  Display location: choose the interface from which this page should be
      accessed

      -  Librarian and OPAC interfaces: two links will be created, one for the 
         OPAC and one for the staff interface

      -  Librarian interface: a link for the staff interface will be created

      -  OPAC: a link for the OPAC will be created

   -  Library: choose the library for which this page will be available

      - If an OPAC page is limited to a library, only logged in users whose 
        home library matches the page library will be able to access the page.
        
      - Pages limited to a library will not be accessible to OPAC users who are 
        not logged in, unless your system administrator has configured an 
        'OPAC_BRANCH_DEFAULT' override in virtual host configuration.
        
      - If a staff interface page is limited to a library, only staff logged 
        into that library will be able to access the page.

   -  Publication date: use the publication date field to control from which 
      date your page is accessible, if it should only be accessed at a future 
      date.
      
      .. -  If the publication date is set to today, before today or is left blank, 
         the page will be immediately accessible.
         
      .. -  If the publication date is set in the future, the page will only be 
         accessible at that date or later.
         This currently doesn't work. See bug 32020.

   -  Expiration date: use the expiration date field to remove the page after a 
      specific date.

      -  If this field is empty the page will be available until you remove it 
         manually

         .. This currently doesn't work. See bug 32020.

   -  You can enter the page title and content for each language installed 

.. Note::

      You can choose which type of editor to use here (either a text editor or 
      a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editor) with the 
      :ref:`AdditionalContentsEditor <additionalcontentseditor-label>` system preference.

-  After filling in all of the fields, click 'Save' at the top of the page.

   -  Alternatively, click the arrow next to the 'Save' button and choose
      'Save and continue editing' if you need to stay on this page to continue
      editing the news item.

-  In the table, a link will be generated for the OPAC or the staff interface 
   or both. Use this link in HTML customizations, news or system preferences 
   such as :ref:`IntranetNav<intranetnav-label>` or 
   :ref:`IntranetmainUserBlock<intranetmainuserblock-label>` so that the 
   patrons or staff members can access the new page.

   .. Note::

      To link to a specific page, use the code in the URL with the :code:`code=`
      parameter. For example::

       OPACBASEURL/cgi-bin/koha/opac-page.pl?code=staff_and_opac_42

       STAFFCLIENTBASEURL/cgi-bin/koha/tools/page.pl?code=staff_and_opac_42

      In multi-language installations, use the :code:`language=` parameter
      followed by the language code to link to the page in a specific language.
      For example::

       OPACBASEURL/cgi-bin/koha/opac-page.pl?code=staff_and_opac_42&language=fr-CA

       STAFFCLIENTBASEURL/cgi-bin/koha/tools/page.pl?code=staff_and_opac_42&language=fr-CA

To use a custom page

Once the page has been developed and saved, you will see a summary table of all custom pages. 
This table also displays the generated links to access these custom pages. The links will be available in both the default 
language, and the installed language currently in use by the logged in staff member.

|pages|

There is a button to preview the created page. This is helpful to check how the page looks and functions before it is deployed.

|pagepreview|

Now the page has been created, there are a number of ways to make the page accessible to your patrons in the Koha OPAC.

|pageexample|

One option is to use an HTML customisation to add the link to the page to a section of the OPAC. The page can be added as 
a navigation link (in OpacNav, OpacNavBottom, or OpacNavRight). Depending on the page, it may be more suitable in the header 
(opacheader), footer (opaccredits), or main section of the homepage (OpacMainUserBlock).

HTML customizations are only displayed on the OPAC, so News items would be the appropriate tool to add the link to
the main landing page of the staff interface.

|opacnavexample|

The benefit of putting the page link in an HTML customization or News item is that you can use the WYSIWYG editor, instead of
writing code. However, there is always the option to write the content in the HTML text editor too, if you prefer.

Those more proficient in writing code could use jQuery (Javascript) to insert their page link anywhere in the OPAC or staff interface.

|opacuserjsexample|

Using jQuery, the pages could be added to either interface as simple text links, or as more advanced button links or image links. Add code 
to the OPACUserJS system preference to apply jQuery to the OPAC, or to the IntranetUserJS system preference to apply jQuery to the staff interface.


Clever ways to use custom pages:

There are many interesting ways to use custom pages in a Koha library. Weâ€™ve heard discussion of pages being used for tables of contents, 
frequently asked questions pages for the library, and enquiry forms.

|pageexample-form|

Another way to make custom Koha page content accessible for users, would be to catalogue those pages so 
they pop in in Koha search results, for example library tutorials that patrons may be looking for.

|pageexample-record|

Once the page has been created, it can be catalogued in the URI field of a record (856$u). Alternatively, it could 
be catalogued in the URI field of an item attached to a record (952$u). Both of these fields get converted into hyperlinks
by Koha. If catalogued in a record or item, it would then be indexed and become searchable.

Once catalogued, these pages could be used in other ways that are typically reserved for books and other records. The records 
representing pages can be added to lists, or stored in virtual collections or locations that make them easier to find in the catalogue. 
They could even be captured and displayed in carousels!

.. _troubleshooting-label:

Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Task scheduler will not work if the user the web server runs as doesn't
have the permission to use it. To find out if the right user has the
permissions necessary, check /etc/at.allow to see what users are in it.
If you don't have that file, check etc/at.deny. If at.deny exists but is
blank, then every user can use it. Talk to your system admin about
adding the user to the right place to make the task scheduler work.

Cash management
---------------

Koha includes a number of options for dealing with monetary transactions and 
actions to allow for fine grained tracking of these processes for audit and
analytic processes.

.. _cash-management-registers-label:

Cash registers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cash registers can be used to track transactions to a specific location in your
library. This can be especially helpful for detailing where cash has been taken
for payments and then when this cash is subsequently removed and taken to the 
bank.

Setup
^^^^^

To enable the use of cash registers, you must turn on the :ref:`UseCashRegisters <usecashregisters-label>`
system preference. 

You can then configure cash registers for your library from the 
:ref:`cash registers <cashregisters-label>` page in the administration module.

.. _cash-management-register-cashup-label:

Cashup
^^^^^^

The action of 'cashing up' can be recorded against a cash register from both 
the :ref:`library details <cash-management-library-details-label>` and 
:ref:`register details <cash-management-register-details-label>` pages.

Clicking the `Record cashup` button will simply record the date and time that
the action has taken place and is intended to allow the regular record of when 
money is collected from the cash register and taken to the bank.

Both of the above pages utilize the cashup record to limit the display of 
transactions/summaries to only pertinent information, since the last cashup.

Once a cashup has taken place, a summary of the transactions taken during that
cashup period is available for display, and printing, via the `Summary` link 
found next to the last cashup date on the register details page.

available to take to the bank and a breakdown of income vs outgoings.

*Note:* You can also access this page from the left hand menu available on the
:ref:`Point of sale <point-of-sale-label>` page when that module is enabled.

.. _cash-management-register-details-label:

If you have the correct permissions, you can re-print receipts, issue refunds
and record :ref:`cashups <cash-management-register-cashup-label>` from this page.

*Note:* You can also access this page from the left hand menu available on the
:ref:`Point of sale <point-of-sale-label>` page when that module is enabled.
